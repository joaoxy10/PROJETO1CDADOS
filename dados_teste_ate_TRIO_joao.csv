"These look delicious and when you first chew, they are delicious. But it did not take long before I started feeling nauseated and ill. There is also a terrible aftertaste that lingers for a while. Be careful.",0.0
"Whenever I give my dogs something to chew on I hope it keeps them busy for a while and tire them out.  These Fun Bites are too big for my Chihuahua (it is suggested for dogs over six pounds), but for my medium sized mix breed, it would take her about a half an hour to finish them off.  I really cannot comment on the ""digestive support"" that the Fun Bites advertise but she does not seem any different as to the way then before she ate these.<br /><br />What is annoying about this product is the labeling as they have important data and warning on the bottom of the package making it very hard to read it without ripping or cutting it.  If it is important, how about putting the warning wear someone can actually read it?",1.0
"This rum cake has little chocolate flaver and chocolate color I don't know why, it dosen't says on box, it is very moist, I wish it not so bitter.",0.0
"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better.",0.0
"As like the others have already said, a very delicious, rich, strong coffee that will keep you going all day. It is very good by itself, or with milk, or my personal favorite, some chocolate coffee creamer. I purchased both Jet Fuel and Wake Up call, they are both very smooth and I use them interchangeably The packaging and delivery was top notch, as is usual with amazon. Amazon is the best place to purchase any K-cups as can be found out by price comparison to other retailers.",1.0
"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy.",0.0
"I bought several different brands of the Chai concentrate from Amazon, as there are few options in my rural area's grocery stores.<br /><br />The Tazo Organic Chai is my favorite.  It most closely matches that served by Starbucks.  Only difference is it doesn't have the foam.  I've been told it is what they use.<br /><br />Tazo decaf is my second choice.  Strangely, it is not as good as the Tazo Organic Chai... not as spicy, but OK for drinking in the evening.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Original is not as good in my opinion as the Tazo.  It is missing something.  Not enough cardamon or pepper or something.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Sugar-free was very disappointing.  I was hoping there was a good sugar-free option out there as I'd like to avoid the daily calories from my Chai habit.  It just takes like plain tea with mil in my opinion.  It seems to mostly lack the complex, spicy flavor or the Tazo Chai.  Not sure why that is.  The sweetener should have no bearing on the other ingredients.  I have been unable to find any suitable concentrated, sugar-free Chai tea options.  Post if you find one.",0.0
"KIND bar is little like fine dinning, they don't give you a huge portion, and its quite expensive compared to others, but the portion they give you is so good. This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well.",2.0
Best hazelnut flavored coffee I have found.  The K-cups came in one box.  The K-cups are so easy to use.  Delivered fast as well.,2.0
"Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!",0.0
"When I opened the package, the salt did not look right. I compared it to some of the Himalayan salt I had from Whole foods and it was a lighter pink. Opened the bag and tasted it. It sure tasted like regular salt was added. Great price but you get what you pay for. Nice trick.",0.0
"Speedy shipment on this product...have not tried it yet but the quality, packaging and so forth seem very good.",1.0
"These are decent sun dried tomatoes, but they are NOT what is described. They are dried tomatoes in a pouch. There is no olive oil and there is no jar. This is not what I ordered. Both the photograph and the item description are incorrect. Amazon was nice enough about refunding my money, once I found a way to contact them by phone.",0.0
"Zoe Lifestyle Treats for Dogs are a healthy alternative to the typical high-calorie dog snacks which you find in stores today. The product is gluten-free and is a good source of soluble fiber. These treats are as hard as a rock which would probably be troublesome for older dogs with poor teeth. I tested these treats on a 2-year-old lab and a 9-year-old golden retriever. Keep in mind...they will eat just about anything. Both dogs threw the sticks on the ground and proceeded to sniff them.  I am not sure, but I think the cinnamon spice flavor threw them off a bit.  After rolling the sticks around on the ground, I am happy to report that they ate them. The next day, I offered them another treat and they didn't seem too excited. Overall, if you are into healthy dog food, these snacks are sensible treats. Personally, I wouldn't buy them again due to the price and the firmness of the product. I would be concerned that my dog would break a tooth.",0.0
"What more can you say, Slim Jim is known commodity, with reliable texture and the favor of this product lives up to its billing.  Amazon is providing a great price point.",1.0
"The texture of this is beautiful...the taste is, frankly, yucky. At first I thought it tasted a little like artificial lemon flavoring rather than ""cheesecake"" but then the aftertaste is really unpleasant very artificial. Bummer.",0.0
"Definitely use the smallest amount of water and be sure to shake the cup before brewing.  The kids got a kick out of making their own ""kid coffee"" but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and brewed it with 3 marshmallows on top. (The hot cocoa hitting the marshmallows releases added sugar as well as turns the marshmallows nice and mushy :)<br /><br />The rest of us don't care to waste our daily calories on something that was, in our opinion, chocolatey water.  Still, it was worth the price for the simple fact that the kiddos can come in from sledding and brew their own hot cocoa without much mess.",1.0
This cheese is wonderful.  It reminds of my youth in Lebanon Pa.  Combine this with a piece of sweet bologna cut into a triangle of similar size and I'm in heaven!,2.0
"Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!",0.0
"These cookies taste great, my kids love them! I feel good about giving them a healthier snack. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star is becuase each bag comes with 2 servings in it. This makes them a little less convenient to use while traveling, but with an extra bowl or baggie that problem is easily solved. Will definitely buy again!",1.0
"We were given a Keurig coffee machine for a gift. We really like the ease and convenience of use, but the K-cups can be very expensive. I've done extensive comparison shopping, and this particular deal is the best I've found (in online or retail stores, and even different packs here on Amazon). There are not a lot of K-cup decaffeinated choices, but since I like hazelnut flavor, this is a good choice for me.<br /><br />This is a nice mild hazelnut decaf at a good price.",2.0
These are the best!  What a wonderful way to provide a treat for yourself and your kids knowing how healthy and pure they are.  The taste is excellant and satisfies that sweet tooth.  Highly recommend that you try these.,2.0
"When I opened the carton I found 4 packets consisting of:<br /><br />A. A clear packet containing what was described as pasta and had some similarity to orzo.<br /><br />B. A paper packet which was labeled as being some type of seasoning.<br /><br />C. A silver foil packet which held the cheese.<br /><br />D. Another paper packet marked as broccoli but that was a misnomer because the contents clearly appeared to be sawdust from a green shingle.<br /><br />There was no chicken. So much for truth in advertising. There actually was no broccoli either - just some sawdust apparently swept off the floor.<br /><br />I went to Publix and bought some chicken and followed the instructions on the back of the box. I did not, of course, add the sawdust. After adding the cheese I tried a sample and it was edible but not with much of a flavor. It was just OK but no great shakes. That is my reason for the three stars.  I then added a can of Ro*tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. This I topped of with my favorite seasonings and some crumbled Publix saltines. The result was a much improved meal with a significantly improved taste.<br /><br />I actually cannot see any reason for buying this product. You would do better to buy some orzo, chicken and your favorite type of cheese. You most likely have some seasonings already. If you want to add brocolli buy some fresh and steam it for a few minutes and throw it into the mix. Add whatever your imagination and taste buds find pleasurable. You will have a far superior meal.",1.0
"This mix makes nice crispy waffles but the flavor was surprisingly bland.  Next time I make them I'll throw in a tablespoon or two of sugar and see if that helps.  I was hoping for a mix comparable to Bellegem and this is not that mix. If you're looking for waffles with amazing flavor, you should pass this one up and try Bellegem instead.",1.0
"Starbucks is notorious for having a bitter/burnt aftertaste. Such is the case with their packaged coffee as well. But the vanilla flavoring helped and made for a nice cup of coffee. I may not be the best person to review coffee since I take mine fairly sweet, but I enjoyed the cups I've had from this blend.",1.0
"This is one of the best tasting vanilla shakes around.  I'm so happy I tried this, its a nice change from the usual chocolate.  I made this in the blender with water and ice, kinda thick so it would last awhile.  Even my kids like this one and want their own milkshake when they see this come out of the cupboard!",2.0
This sugar smells and taste wonderfully! I changed to only using this sugar. It also healthier than regular sugar because because of its GI load on blood sugar,2.0
"i'm gonna keep this short and sweet<br /><br />Tastes like play-doh, if you like to eat play-doh.. BUY THESE NOODLES, you won't be dissapointed.<br /><br />Update: decided to eat real play-doh after trying to eat these noodles. the play-doh tasted better.",0.0
"These don't taste like I'm dieting. I only need about 3 crackers for my can of sardines. I really can't tell any difference from these and regular crackers. My wife loves them. I also like the Ryvita crispbreads, but my wife will only eat the Breton crackers.",2.0
I need to educate myself on more variety of uses for this product.  I like it but don't use it much.,1.0
"I originally purchased this for a diabetic cat. Unfortunately the carbohydrate values are higher than she can handle well. According to their customer service representative on September 1, 2009 ""The carbs, as fed are 12%.""<br /><br />Since I had a bag of cat food I couldn't feed to the cat it was purchased for I began feeding it to my other cats. Their hair coats are much improved, which is interesting since they weren't that bad to start with, and the thinner cat that had a hard time maintaining her weight is now carrying a very good weight. All of the cats I've tried to feed it to have found it very palatable as long as the bag is sealed well when it arrives and is kept sealed when not in use.",1.0
DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.,0.0
"Although I have a shot of scotch several times a week, I don't own a shot glass.  When I saw this item online, I thought it was a great ""excuse"" to get one since it'll serve both as a shot glass and an aerator (expensive one at that..!!!)  It actually works.  You can tell the difference when pouring straight out of the bottle vs. through this aerator.  Just like the one for wine, this brings out the bouquet of the spirit and the taste is slightly more pronounced.",2.0
"I was really impressed, and I think this is my new favorite flavor. I wish they had this in the full size tins, although i assume they aren't very popular. it tastes a lot like peppermint, but there is a distinct difference. this one tastes more Swedish. yes, it tastes Swedish.",1.0
"Bought these at Whole Foods and served them with very nice guacamole.  Everyone had an odd look on his face as they chewed and chewed on these things.<br /><br />""Spicy cardboard"" was about the nicest thing anyone had to say.  One person said they would make nice wood filler.",0.0
"I used to sell these cookies in my health food store.  Several years ago my celiac and gluten sensitive customers began complaining that they had reacted to these cookies.  I read the back of the box,(you should always read the back of the box) where it stated that these cookies were made on equipment also used to process wheat.  I also found that in order to make these cookies more price competitive, the manufacturer added soy flour to the recipe.  I would suggest to anyone who is celiac to look for another brand that is made in dedicated wheat free facility.",0.0
"I like many of the Japanese snack food items, but this is definitely my favorite! I don't really know how to describe them...the filling is sort of a whipped, soft kind of chocolate/vanilla/strawberry flavored concoction in a sugar cone. Whatever it is, is DELICIOUS.",2.0
"I was born and grew up in Indianolia, Iowa, which during my youth was a small town just south of Des Moines (its a lot bigger now!).  I have always been a hometown boy!  I love my hometown.  I have VERY fond memories of my hometown.  I would do anything for my hometown.  Imagine my joy when I came across the listing for ""Hometown Favorites"" candy!  How fantastic, an entire box of candy made in my hometown of Indianolia, Iowa!  I figured this would be the greatest box of candy I ever bought, one that would combine my moderate love of sweets and my gigantic love of my hometown.<br /><br />I anticipated the arrival of my candy for several days; each day bring me closer and closer to the edge of expectation overload.  Finally, the candy arrived and I busted open the box furiously pouring over the wide selection of candies and scanning the wrappers for any hint of Indianolia, Iowa.  Imagine my incredible disappointment when my hometown was not mentioned on one single piece of candy or even the box for that matter.  Heatedly, I ran to my computer with my new box of candy.  I typed and typed, my original joy dissipating with each keystroke as i learned one piece of candy after another was manufactured somewhere other than Indianolia!<br /><br />This product description is false advertising!  This candy had NO connection to my hometown of Indianolia.  This product gets one star for suckering me into buying it by capitalizing on my hometown pride.<br /><br />The candy was delicious though.",0.0
"Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.",1.0
"At first I was thinking they were incredibly expensive, but after I thought about what is in them (whole almonds and macadamia nuts) it's probably a very fair price.  They are really really good! I figured they'd make a good breakfast bar but I've found myself eating them for dessert instead of chocolate - they're that good.",1.0
"For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support.",2.0
"My indoor cat loves cat grass. I've tried a few other products, but they either get knocked over by my cat due to the flimsy design, or the grass doesn't grow very quickly.  This grass planter kit is GREAT! It has a beautiful design and the solid base stays put in my kitchen bay window.  The grass began growing within 2-3 days and my cat happily noshes on it several times a day now.  He's a big cat, but, so far, he has not knocked the base over when he sniffs and chews on it.  Happy kitty - happy owner!",2.0
"These were okay - but not worth the price even at subscribe and save for what you actually get.<br />The flavors are interesting, but not all that great tasting.  Worth a try once, but I would not purchase them again.",1.0
"I am a cola junkie. I can't get enough Pepsi, Coke, or even RC Cola. The problem is all the extra calories. I cannot tolerate aspartame or sucralose (poisons!) because they both make me extremely naseated. Now I can drink ""diet"" soda. It's guilt-free bliss!<br /><br />As a non-diet soda drinker, I really don't mind the slight aftertaste of Zevia cola at all. It's sweet and lingering for the first few sips, but it's barely noticeable after that. From what I remember of Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi, they left a very chemical-tasting coating in my mouth. Not only did they make me physically ill, they tasted awful! Zevia actually tastes good to me, someone who doesn't normally drink diet sodas.<br /><br />If this miracle beverage was a little cheaper, I think everyone, diet and non-diet soda lovers alike, would be enjoying it. I can't wait for the price to drop. That's really the only complaint I have about the product.",2.0
"My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.",2.0
"They took out the sugar, but replaced it with sucralose.  I ordered this because I like less flavoring and more of a plain oatmeal taste.  If calories were a concern, I wouldn't eat instant flavored oatmeal at all.  Duh.<br /><br />Deceptively labeled and marketed, terrible product.",0.0
When I opened the box all I got were 6 very hard bags of dried up sugar. Very disappointing.,0.0
"These cappucino k-cups are truly awful. I pre-ordered this one as well as the french vanilla one and they are both horrible. The consistency, taste, and smell are exactly like the cappucino you get out of those machines at the gas station. Don't bother, there are way better k-cups out there...the green mountain espresso one and the gloria jean cappucino ones are much better. Yes you have to mix your own milk in, but you can get creative and get a cheap foamer to use with different flavored creamers. Way better.",0.0
I first found this tea in Australia.  It is great to be able to purchase it here.  I love the spiciness of the Australian Breakfast tea!  Excellent service too!,2.0
Always ready to try something new.  The problem with this product is that it did not have a lot of flavour to it.  You would expect a strong expresso taste but what I tasted was water?<br /><br />The only plus with this is that it only has 100 calories.  But when I want a cold coffee shot I will stick to my Frappacino (bottled from the grocery store not from the Starbucks),1.0
"For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!",1.0
I'm an ER doctor and work long hours - sometimes day shifts and sometimes night shifts. I've always struggled with finding something healthy I could take to stay awake. Coffee tends to give me heartburn and the 5 hour energy drinks don't do anything for me. One of my friends gave me one of these pills to try and I was AMAZED. Literally right after taking it I felt more alert. It lasted for about ten hours and then I was able to sleep without feeling a crash. I was more social/friendly and just felt like my eyes were more open/aware. I could do my job better. I've never had anything like this before. Needless to say I bought a bottle and shared it with all the people I work with and they're all hooked. I haven't heard a single person say it doesn't work for them. I don't know where this stuff came from but it's the real deal.,2.0
"WHEN THEY CALL IT BREAD THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH..........IT'S MOSTLY BREAD WITH A LITTLE FLAVORING INSIDE.  I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND IT'S GOTTEN LOUSIER EVERY YEAR.

IT'S NOW TASTELESS ROLLS OF BREAD WITH NO CHEESE AT ALL.  AND DRY....OHHH.... SO DRY!!!  I WILL DEFINITELY NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A NEW CHEF BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE IT IS BEING MADE WITH CHEAPER AND POORER QUALITY FOOD WITHOUT SAVING $$ IN MIND.

"Like many of the other reviewers, I've tried all of the premium dog foods out there. When our family hit some tough financial times, I began looking for a good food that would be a better fit with our budget. This food absolutely fits the bill.  My golden retriever mix is not crazy about it, but that doesn't bother me that much--he's a good weight, and he will eat it when he's hungry.  He's had some allergy issues in the past and I was sure this food would kick them into gear, but it didn't--after fully transitioning to this food he has not gotten itchy at all.  I'm definitely going to stick with Chicken Soup... why pay twice as much on dog food if you don't have to?",2.0

All I can say is YUCK.",0.0
"I basically gave up ""flavored"" coffee years ago after a brief love affair with coffee beans laced with chocolate, vanilla, raspberry, gran marnier, etc. But this Vanilla Starbucks is different than the flavored coffees I used to drink. This does taste like a nice, full bodied coffee (and not bitter) with just a subtle hint of real vanilla taste and aroma. It reminds me more of a cup of coffee after adding a shake or two of the real vanilla powder. Its very satisfying. While I still prefer the dark italian roasts this is a real treat and fits perfectly into the holiday season. Excellent!",2.0

This is a little pricey for the quality.  It can be made to work with the B150 but you need to modify the K Cup holder.  There are two ribs in the holder that need to be removed with a Dremel or similar tool in order to use it.  The first time I put the cup in it didn't fit.  After removing the two ribs it works fine.  Makes no difference when using standard K-Cups after the modification.  Just be sure not to put a hole in the side of the holder or it won't work anymore.  Also would be pretty sure this would void the warranty.,1.0

"Both the 5-Star and the 1-Star reviewers have a point.  German potato dumplings are an acquired taste.  I married a good German(-American)girl and we were stationed in Germany (Bavaria) for four years, so I've acquired the taste.  The mix isn't quite as good as the Gastehaus staple, but the dumplings are pretty darn close.  If you try them on your redneck dinner guests without warning, however, you're liable to get a 1-Star reaction.  They are heavy and gummy.  With Sauerbraten und Rotkohl, that's what makes them great.",1.0

"A friend recommended this tea, saying that it basically knocked her out at bedtime. I have two small kids so that really isn't a problem, but I liked the idea of a nice relaxing tea to enjoy during a little quiet time at night.<br /><br />This tea is wonderful. I brewed it up, enjoying the vapors, then drank it in a leisurely fashion (while watching ""Scrubs"", but that's neither here nor there). It is very tasty. My cat wanted to eat the teabag in a big way, which was charming. Then she climbed up on my lap to smell my breath, which was just adorable.<br /><br />I didn't doze off on the couch, which I half-expected based on what my friend had said, but I was verrrry melllooooooow. In a good way. A very good way.<br /><br />If you love tea but can't drink the caffeinated stuff at night, try this. It is yum.",2.0

I tried the Nutiva brand after purchasing another brand of coconut oil. I love the taste of this brand and use it all the time - my local health food store has it on sale quite often. Coconut oil has many uses - I just scoop out enough product and place in storage containers to use on my hair/body and the rest stays in the kitchen to use for cooking. I find that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin when I need to address dryness. Sometimes I add a drop or two of Eucalyptus essential oil to  the coconut oil and apply to my body as well. Works great as a hot oil treatment for your hair - since coconut oil is in a solid form at 76 degrees or less - just heat up a small amount in a container and apply to your hair.,2.0

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",0.0

"Lipton Green Tea to Go, blackberry/pomegranate offers a fresh-tasting delicate sweet tea that delivers five calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product, the manufacturer states, is made from real tea leaves and contains 80 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with real fruit flavors, and is, as well, easy to prepare; just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  I find the caffeine helps as a pick-me-up when I get in hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love the berries of summer, all of them, blueberries, and blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, stop me before I start raving...  I just, at a local farm stand, run by a local farmer with a good reputation, bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all at once, with only me to eat them.  And I did, don't worry about that.  Anyway, the pomegranate taste here does add a bit of tartness, and pomegranate is also considered quite healthy.  However, in the  list of ingredients I find Aspartame (Sweetener), Corn Syrup Solids, Modified Corn Starch,  Maltodextrin, and  Acesulfame Potassium as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  Of course, I'm not a dietitian, I just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know.",1.0

"The teapot does not have a spout.  Also, the tea blossoms are not labeled.  You have to guess by matching the picture to the little balls of tea in a bag and hope you got the right one.  The tea is light, if you don't like strong tea you'll like this and has a pretty good flavor.  Keep in mind that this is a 16oz teapot--a smaller bottle of water is 16.5oz just to put it into perspective.  If you use regular size coffee cups for it and not actual tea cup then you will get about 1 1/2 cups of tea each time you fill it.  The blossoms also will come apart slightly and you will get small tea leaves in your cup, I would suggest using a tea strainer.  If you don't own a tea strainer already you can  use a coffee filter to catch the smaller pieces of tea leaves by simply holding it over your cup as you pour allowing the tea to filter through into the cup through the coffee filter.  Also, the blossom may float if it has a few air bubbles in it from drying.  Poke it down with a spoon to make it settle--more for presentation.",1.0
"As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups!  I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the ""My Kcup"" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer.<br /><br />The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that's the main appeal of this.  You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups.  It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please.  Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.  Then rinse it out and it's ready to go again.  I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other.  I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use.",2.0

"These Dark Cherry bars are purported to be healthy nutrition bars. There is really nothing healthy or nutritious about these ""Eat Think Smile"" bars. They are high in calories (200), fat (7g) and carbs (34g), they have essentially no vitamin content either. The claim is that because they contain cocoa (chocolate) they are good for you because chocolate is supposed to be an antioxidant. That is a very tenuous assumption that has not been fully proven. The only ingredients that might be healthy are the cherries and the oats. I eat Zone nutrition bars and Kellog's Fiber Plus bars. Both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients.<br /><br />I read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these ""Eat Think Smile"" bars. The claim is that these bars are a smart choice! If you are starving and only alternative is eating dirt, the dirt might be a healthier choice actually. I really dislike companies that create this kind of ridiculous untrue hype about any product.<br /><br />These ""Eat Think Smile"" bars are basically cookies and that would be ok if they tasted good but they don't.

"As a lover of popcorn, over the course of my half century on this planet, I've pretty much run the gamut on the variety of ways to eat this delight -- over the stove, the air popper and then by nuking it. All were fads that faded over time. Then, through the greatness of Amazon, I found the Whirley popper, and ordered their popcorn to go along with it. It was great, albeit a bit expensive. Then I discovered Great Northern's Great American popcorn.<br />Not only was the Great American popcorn cheaper in price, but by comparison, the six-ounce package I ordered was larger than the similarly-packaged Whirley Pop at 5.5 ounces. The taste was probably about the same, although psychologically it tasted better to me because of the better value.<br />I probably went a little overboard, but thanks to the special 99-cent shipping at the time, I purchased three 24-count cases.<br />Each of these packages produces a whole lotta popcorn, which if not eaten right away, is still really good a week to 10 days later.<br />Just a great value for middle aged people who could use a little great-tasting ruffage in their systems!<br />Gotta go; feel another batch coming on!!!",2.0

"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

"I have been using this brand for about two months, but I was using the one with the new and improved formula. I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate. I was wrong this one doesn't dissolve as well and it doesn't taste like chocolate, it's more of a bitter taste. Also it doesn't  keep me full 4-5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it's $20 at Sams Club!!!

Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",1.0

"Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say ""WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!"".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.",1.0

You add hot water to the noodles and the dried garnish mix, put it in the microwave, and cook for one minute. Then you take it out and using the lid, drain the water out.<br /><br />I tried putting the mix on the bottom of the noodles but they still came out when I poured the water out. And I agree with the other reviewer that the lid isn't the best way to strain the water out and that's why I deducted one-star.

"First impression: meh. I sampled a few more, and the flavor kind of grew on me. You can taste all the ingredients you're supposed to notice--oats, cranberries, a little hint of citrus. Then I tried it with my coffee, and it was GOOD.<br /><br />I think that's the key--other reviewers have noted that tea or coffee goes great with this snack. It's not something you can mindlessly shove into your mouth while watching reality shows, not that I ever do that, but if you need a little treat in the afternoon, it's tasty with a cup of joe.<br /><br />The cranberries made this chewy, which was a nice combination (like pinwheel cookies). Putting two textures together can be tricky, and if not done correctly, is a real turn-off for me. But here the crunchy/chewy textures enhance each other.<br /><br />My family tasted these, as well. One of my kids liked the cookie but thought the calorie count a little high for a serving of three (140 calories). Not a big deal, but if you're going for the health-conscious crowd, that may be a little too steep.

If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.

For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  There are some great suggestions mentioned by other reviewers, like mint for example.",1.0

"The box shipped to me receives one star for old and stale inventory.<br />The product itself receives 5 stars.<br />Amazon receives 5 stars for refunding the full purchase amount.<br />Customer Service receives 5 starts for their professional conduct.<br /><br />For several years I have been purchasing my favorite LaraBar flavors at the nearest Trader Joe's location. I recently moved to an area where TJ has little presence, if any, and ordered the bars from Amazon instead. Although the label on the box had indicated the expiration date was 10 months away, the first bar I chewed into was dry, stale, with a bitter after taste. This is disappointing because I am familiar with this product and I know what flavor to expect. I still like LaraBar and will continue to consume it but my next purchase will have to be from a brick and mortar location where I can sample an individual bar prior to purchasing a full box.<br />Upon my request Amazon had issued a full refund for this purchase.

"This popcorn isn't bad tasting, but doesn't live up to the claim that it's like theater popcorn.  I think it's a little pricey based on the quantity of popped corn and the overall quality.  However, it is very convenient and hasn't gone to waste when made.  This full pack produces about the same corn quantity as half to three-quarter cup of Orville's.  If more of the corn popped (lots of kernels wasted) and/or the price was reduced, I would give it a 5 rating because of the combination of decent quality, good price, and convenience.",1.0

"After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!",0.0

"After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried.

"When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!",0.0

"I lived on instant coffee all through college, and came to know its taste and texture all too well.  Because of that, I was skeptical about Starbucks ""instant"" coffee.

I don't use it as a replacement for my brewed coffee, but if the coffee pot at work is empty and I need a quick pick-me up, Via is just the ticket.  This could work just fine as a substitute for brewed coffee, but as long as I have a coffee pot, it is a bit cheaper than Via.",2.0

"Again, I had a problem with the product leaking ---  Both my original and replacement order. The manufacturer's packaging simply does not protect the contents enough. The box soaked through and this time, one of the top faces just tore right off because it was so damp.<br /><br />When I buy other liquids from Amazon such as the ""Zola Acai drink""<br />([...]), the plastic containers are better equipped to sustain the shipping process unlike these coconut water cartons.<br /><br />I really enjoy Vita Coco's coconut water products. The taste is light, refreshing and hardly sweet at all. And yes, it is thirst-quenching. However, I do not recommend this larger packaging size. The other tetra packaging for the smaller individual cartons is better equipped for impact. Since I lost much of the drink from the leakage on both orders, I cannot give a high rating.

"It would seem that whole grain Goldfish would be a bit healthier than regular Goldfish. I can't say much about that aspect, but I can say that after eating a bag of the Whole Grain Goldfish, I don't taste much of a difference between this variety and the regular Goldfish other than the welcome absense of that paprika taste. Both are mildly cheesy in flavor and for my tastes a bit on the bland side.  Because of this blandness and lack of total satisfaction, I find it easy to overeat when snacking on these  crackers.<br /><br />The package touts 0g of trans fat. Be aware that the total fat content of a serving (55 pieces) is five grams of fat. A serving also delivers 140 calories. I'm sure I never eat less than two servings at a time when snacking on Goldfish.<br /><br />The lack of artificial flavors is a good thing, and also handy is that kids love these things and enjoy them in their lunch bags. Also a plus is that these snacks don't leave much residue on one's fingers, especially nice when eating them away from home.<br /><br />First ingredient in this Gold Fish recipe is smiles. Last ingredient is onion powder.",1.0

"I was really rooting for this toy to work out, because my Frenchie Tobias loves playing with plastic bottles and he loves treats. The Tug a jug should be the perfect combo, right? The one I purchased had the rope, not the rubber thing. In theory, when you tip the toy treats should fall out relatively easily, according to various instructions and videos I found through internet searches. But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.<br /><br />He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.<br /><br />I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part. He did leave scratches all over it, but hasn't yet managed to crack it. However, I think it's only a matter of time.",0.0

"I have been enjoying coconut water for over 2 years.  For the most part I love the natural ""regular"" variety, but was able to buy a variety pack through Amazon.  After tasting the different flavored varieties, I found that I liked the tangerine but LOVED the peach/mango.  So far, the boxes I have enjoyed have been very consistent in flavor, which is the only downside to coconut water that I have found to date.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about these waters was the container.  It has a small screw top that makes the container resealable and less likely to spoil and/or spill in between drinks.  At 17 ounces it is unlikely for me to finish drinking it in one sitting so I really appreciate this small innovation.  I wish they could do this on the 11 ounce containers but this product is costly enough without adding to the expense.<br /><br />I am giving this particular product 5 stars, because of the combination of great taste and the innovative packaging.  If you need to pay attention to sugar, stick with the unflavored coconut waters because this is sweet, with about twice the natural sugars of the unflavored.  Not a reason to downgrade the product, but something to make a note of if sugar is an issue in your life.<br /><br />Give it a try and enjoy!",2.0

"Disposakups....great idea, because K-kups are expensive and aren't necessarily available in your favorite coffee.<br /><br />Disposakups fit well into the Keurig coffee maker, the lid snaps on firmly to the disposakup after you fill it with your favorite coffee or tea.  However, the problem comes with the filter which wicks the hot coffee under pressure out of the disposakup from under the lid.<br /><br />I tried several of these disposakups. After the first few leaked I thought maybe I was not snapping the lid on tight enough, so I made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on REALLY tight, no gaps! They still leaked about 5 or 6 drops from each disposakup, which then drips outside the k-kup holder chamber...and outside the catch area.  I needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use.<br /><br />I give this item 3 stars because they do work, and are a great idea, but the design of the filter protruding from around the cap causes the leaking.  If you don't mind a bit of cleanup after each use....you'll appreciate these.<br /><br />I'll use the rest of the box, and continue cleaning up after each use, but I won't buy more.<br /><br />The seller offered a refund, but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as I would receive as a refund.",1.0

"When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled.

The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.

"This toy was highly recommended by my trainer, so I thought I'd give it a try, desperate to find anything to keep my ""little"" guy (70+ lb Lab mix puppy) and my adult German Shepherd busy for more than a couple minutes.  The first time, the treats stayed in for about an hour but were devoured 5 minutes later.  I then tried the caps with the screw rod in the middle, my puppy had it disassembled and devoured in under 10 minutes (far less time than it took me to assemble).  Went back to the original caps and this time around they too only lasted about 10 minutes before they were completely devoured as well.  Soon after, my puppy had one side torn completely off and reduced to little blue plastic bits.  While both of my dogs really loved it while it lasted, for the price of the toy and the price of the refills (which sell out from my local store so quickly I have a hard time getting them), for my guys, it just wasn't worth it, but for less aggressive chewers, this would be great.",1.0
As always Haribo Products are the best when it comes to taste. This product is hard to find but is great specially if you are into sour gummies.The only reason I give it 4 not 5 stars is the cost. over 5 dollars for a small bag (175gm-5.8 ounces) seems a little pricy to me.,1.0

"I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the ""special"" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as ""hypnotic"" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush.

"Herbs de Provence can bring many dishes to life. Baked chicken and root veggies are a good place to start, for those who are not familiar with this herb mix. Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.",1.0

"It's a cute idea to produce a cat food that is similar to people food, and Petite Cuisine seems to fill the nutrition needs of cats, if you can believe the label. However, the ""in sauce"" makes things a little messy, especially with the ""Chicken Pot Pie"" entree.

The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication.

Although it significantly more expensive, ie., 2X (than Costco, when shipping is counted), I am buying it from Amazon, in two's. Throw one in the freezer and one in the fridge. Good tuff!!",2.0

"I didn't expect to like this as well as I do. It's crispy, with a salty-sweetness that I sometimes just CRAVE. The pouches are the perfect amount and you get a lot of flavor for 130 calories. I find them a bit TOO sweet though and I could never eat more than just one pouch in a sitting, which I guess is actually a benefit of the product...absolutely no temptation to keep eating.",1.0

These are also the same three cats that prefer the cheaper Whiskas dry food compared to more expensive brands. I won't be buying this again.",0.0
"Highly recommended for table sugar. I purchased xylitol gum for dental protection also.  But I think that putting a quarter teaspoon xylitol into my mouth and holding it there reaches far higher molar/molal (pun intended) concentrations, far higher than using gum as the delivery method.  15 pounds seemed like maybe too much until it arrived, when it seemed like not enough after giving a pickle jar full to grandpa and grandma, a jam jar full to work, several jars full to the kids, and using for most sugar uses. Feels slightly different than sugar in the mouth, seems to get very slightly cold when dissolving, tastes every bit as good as table sugar, to me a little better.",1.0

"This is one of my favorite ""healthy"" cereals.  It's high in protein and fiber, and doesn't contain artificial ingredients or sweeteners that I can't pronounce.  This cereal also fills me up for most of the morning (unlike many high carb, oversweetened cereals). And, most importantly, it actually tastes good!  The flavor sort of reminds me of Cracker Jack - crunchy and slightly caramel-ly.  I like to add blueberries or dried cranberries to it for a little extra sweetness.  It's also great in yogurt.  My only complaint is that some of the clusters in the cereal are really large, so much so that I have to break them up before eating.  A minor complaint, really.  Overall, I highly recommend Go Lean Crunch!",1.0

"My first encounter with these darling little treats was while watching Everyday Italian on the Food Network starring Giada De Laurentiis, my favorite chef of the past few years. She crumbled them into deserts, coffees, made pumpkin ravioli with it, baked amaretti apples and always praised their magical taste. Upon finally purchasing a box myself I was blown away by the hypnotic and addictive taste of marzipan in these little gems.<br /><br />Amaretti Cookies are packed as a pair, wrapped in wax paper with Italian writing and insignias, praising its originality. They are two small crackling cookies per wrapper and they are a crunchy shell of delight. The taste is strangely addictive, after having a few I couldn't stop thinking about them! I have even purchased three more boxes two days after getting the first one. They taste like the holidays, spicy and lusciously laden with almonds and crispy sugary goodness with a tiny tang of bitterness of the almond. They flavor is royal and time stopping, on busy days, one bite of this cookie and I am transfixed into magical fields of luxurious old world taste that has been popular to Italians for years.<br /><br />Incredibly aromatic crispy almond cookies that are a luscious addiction to coffee, tea or wine and are great for cooking and baking with. They really grew on me, I think I am an addict to their taste now, no wonder Giada is so smitten with them!<br /><br />- Kasia S.",2.0
"Very tasty with only 9 grams of sugar, less than many popular energy bars out there.

"I'm not a big flax seed fan.  I know that you should eat some, but they're frankly bland.  Kind's Healthy Grains aren't too bad.  The grain is crunchy and the cinnamon gives it some flavor.  To be honest, I would have liked a bit more since the flavor tends to wash away with milk.  I normally eat it as a breakfast cereal and was also disappointed that there aren't as may 'clusters' as I would have expected.  It seems like most of the clusters in my bag fell apart and I was left with loose oats and flax seed.  I tended to eat this as a breakfast cereal and got about four average bowls out of one bag.<br /><br />Overall, I suppose its healthier for me and wasn't too bad to munch on in the morning.  I did put a bit of the mix into a bowl of oatmeal once and thought it was pretty tasty.  If I have to eat flax seeds, this is as good a way as any.",1.0

"I actually had bad effects using this tea.  I was given it by a friend and was unaware of its medicinal properties (so was my friend, fyi).  Within 15 minutes I was starting to get paranoid and less socially apt, and started to feel distant from everything which was going on.  Before long, I was also tending towards depression (which I've experienced before while on birth control, so I caught the signs of it).  I also felt like fainting at a few points.  The effects did go away within about 5 hours.  This was after drinking only a quarter of a mug of it.<br /><br />These are actually the same reactions I had to two different varieties of the birth control pill.  So, if you've reacted badly to birth control, be warned that you may also react badly to this tea.  Or, you may be lucky in that it will not affect you.

This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.

What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish, and love it.  I also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk, along with cardamom, to make an authentic north African-style coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe.  Granted, orange blossom water is and acquired taste, and I would not recommend tasting it by itself.  It is much better served in small portions, mixed with fruits, nuts, coffees, teas, and pastries.  A superb product!",2.0
"My first experience with GF cookies.  Giving up the ""regular"" cookies, breads and pastas I love has been challenging, to say the least.  I purchased these cookies based on other reviews and I'm glad I did.  The taste, flavor and texture of these cookies is very good.  It was a bit disappointing that most of the cookies had broken, but I understand that's pretty common for GF baked goods, especially when they have to be shipped.  Nonetheless, they were good enough that none of the crumbles were wasted -- I just sprinkled them on top of vanilla ice cream and that was even better.  I most likely will order these again.

"I have been buying these from my local grocery store for a while now and was VERY happy to see the Wisecrackers available on Amazon at about 40% below the grocery store prices (and with free delivery)! Cannot beat that! Aside from the price, why do I buy Wisecrackers:<br /><br />1) TEXTURE and CRUNCH: They are much tougher then regular crackers. They hold MUCH better when you need them for a dip, or a base for a topping. They allow you to ""feel"" the crunch and take a loooong time before getting soggy when covered with a topping.<br /><br />2) TASTE: They taste almost like bread crust, with ONLY 110 calories and 2g of fat for ten good sized crackers (each is about two inches by two inches).<br /><br />REGARDING THE FLAVOUR: I like the sesame variety the most, for their neutral aftertaste. The Pepper variety is not as versitile; in fact, it is quite spicy. You will have to choose the dips and the toppings carefully. However, they can be eaten alone as well, as a light in-between-meal snack.<br /><br />Enjoy!",1.0
"I use a LOT of garlic when I cook, so, this was a very convenient item to keep stocked in my pantry.<br /><br />My only complaints are as follows:<br /><br />A. The jars REEK of garlic even though they weren't leaking (I inspected them all very well). In fact, even the box they were shipped in stank to high heaven like garlic. So, I had to ziplock bag the jars before I put them in the pantry which solved that conundrum.<br /><br />B. This chopped garlic has metabisulfite in it and if you have a sulfite sensitivity this is definitely not the product for you.<br /><br />C. I'm not a big fan of soy oil and this product uses soy oil as the 'oil' in this garlic.<br /><br />Regarding the consistency of this product...this is partially a paste with chunks of chopped garlic so it's more of a mix of paste and chopped garlic rather than just chopped garlic. You definitely need to give it a good stir before you refrigerate it after opening because the oil floats to the top of the jar.<br /><br />The flavor is excellent and worked great in my ginger/lemon/garlic/pepper/honey/mustard/tarragon salad dressing. It cooks up fine as long as you add it AFTER some other food is already in the pan (veggies or meat etc.) because this will pop and splatter (especially at high cooking temps). It worked great in my Italian meatballs and mixed with butter and paprika on my garlic bread.<br /><br />Bonus: The jars are super cute and I'll be keeping them and re-using them for other things.",1.0

But after opening the can, emptying it into a pot to shimmer, and sampling it I changed my mind. Ick! The grated tofu (I assume it is the tofu adding the grittiness to the chili, anyway) is very unpleasant. It didn't taste like tofu, or anything really.. It just felt tough and like plastic. The texture it added was not enjoyable at all.<br /><br />The flavor wasn't anything to rave about either. It was alright, but I couldn't get past how gross that grit was so I wasn't able to eat much of it.<br /><br />In the future I won't take short cuts... I'll just make my own chili from scratch.",0.0

"Easy to use and good flavor. This product is a fine white powder, with clearly visible sugar crystals, that mixes very easily with the espresso and frothed milk for our white chocolate mochas. Product has a good flavor when mixed according to directions: not too sweet. Be aware, this is a flavored powder, probably not white chocolate at all, because it contains no cocoa butter, which I believe is used to make white chocolate. White chocolate isn't chocolate at all. The first three ingredients of this product are sugar, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, and corn syrup solids. You decide whether the price for this is a good value, or whether this is really a white chocolate product or, as the label states, ""SWEET GROUND WHITE CHOCOLATE"" followed by the very important word, in smaller print, ""FLAVOR.""

"Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the ""World Market"" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3.

"After reading some of the positive reviews, I was hopeful that this mixer would be a way to cut down my calories on margaritas at home.  Actually, I have only one margarita no more than three evenings a week, but they are a treat.  The difference in calories is about 5 for the Crystal Light versus 150 in most regular mixers, so I thought it was worth a shot.  I mixed up two quarts exactly as directed.  The color comes out almost exactly the same as my regular margarita mix, but from there the similarity ends.  Well, speaking for myself, this was absolutely the worst margarita I have had in my life.  This mixer has a terrible aftertaste to the point that I didn't even want to finish the margarita.  In my opinion you cannot compare this product to regular margarita mixes.  I'd sooner cut my three margaritas a week down to just one to save the calories.<br /><br />Ingredients from the container are:  Citric acid, maltodextrin, salt, aspartame (sweetener), natural favor, contains less than 2% of acesulfame potassium (sweetener), magnesium oxide, artificial color, yellow 5, blue 1.

"I made my own baby food for my first child, I would spend a whole day every few weeks cooking and pureeing foods in large batches to freeze but with my second I just didn't have the time, so I decided to get a Beaba to make it easier, and boy did it do that! It does take a little prep work and I have to remember to do it before I start our dinner so it's cooled before we all sit down  but it is so much easier than when I did large batches, my blender never got it fine enough, it was kinda chunky and took a lot of work to use separate pots to boil and steam and then the blender, there were a lot more things to wash. The Beaba is so easy to use and clean, I highly recommend it for other busy mothers, I wish I had it for my first child! And I am finding ways to use it for my preschooler too, I add some of the pureed or steamed veggies to her food since it is hard to get vegetables in her, so I will be using this for a long time, well worth the money!",2.0

"I originally tried Caffe D'Vita's jumbo cappucinno can available at Costco and loved it but when I moved out of California found my local Costco in Sequim, WA didn't carry it.  Frantically I tried the Costco suggestion box to no avail so I went to the Caffe D'Vita web site and ordered direct from the manufacturer!  The price is higher in 16OZ canisters but there are several more flavors to choose from including Cinnamon Mocha, Hawaiian Mocha, Pumpkin Spice, Mint Chocolate, Chocolate Rasberry, Amaretto and Orange Mocha.  There are a few other flavors but I don't recommend them due to personnal tastes.  In any event Caffe D'Vita is a terrific alternative and better value compared to the french vanilla cans you see in most grocery and box super stores.<br /><br />My favorites are Hawaiian Mocha, Cinnamon Mocha and the Cappucino.",2.0

"This matcha is not good enough for drinking straight. It doesn't have the bright green color and good aroma that a good quality matcha should.

"Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same.",0.0
"I bought this thinking that real silk flowers would be intertwined through the bamboo.  No where in the description does it say these flowers are fake.  I might as well have gone somewhere else if I wanted a regular bamboo plant.  Without the flowers it's too simple of a plant.  There are only two stalks in mine, so I had to leave the tacky looking flowers in it.  Don't bother buying this.  It's not worth the money.",0.0

"While heating up some oil to fry some vegetables and an egg on, I threw about a tablespoon of this sauce into the frying pan for seasoning. I had used about 1/3 of the bottle so I knew what I was getting myself into. I must have not realized that the oil was too hot to add liquid to without causing it to vaporize. Instantly after pouring it in it began to boil violently. A sizeable cloud of Dave's hot sauce quickly formed above the pan. I thought it would be OK at first. I backed off after getting a small whiff of it. It was very potent--like mace. After about 25 seconds I couldn't stop coughing but I continued cooking thinking that just the small whiff had gotten into the wrong place in my throat and I would soon return to normal. Little did I know that it's vapors were spreading throughout the house. Within minutes my roommates were coughing across the house. My dog was also wheezing.<br />After opening all the windows and doors in the house and turning some fans on I ate my egg/vegetable patty sandwich. Even with no visible signs of Dave's hot sauce left in the pan it was still very hot, to my liking.<br />This sauce should be used with caution. When consumed the wrong way it is very unpleasant.",2.0

"Granted, this coffee is not Starbucks.  Then again, if that's what you're expecting then you won't be happy.  However, this coffee is a great everyday coffee that tastes better than your standard Folgers or Maxwell House but provides a better value.  For the amount of coffee you get (64 oz), it's a better deal than anything I can buy at Sams Club.  The grind is a little more coarse than other ground drip coffees (like Folgers or Maxwell House), and could probably work in a french press if you don't mind a little extra sediment in your coffee.  I was pleasantly surprised at the mellow taste that wasn't weak and have been enjoying this coffee for about a week straight.  I would definitely recommend this coffee to anyone who isn't expecting their coffee to taste like a kick in the face--which by the way, I do love Starbucks in addition to more mellow brews.",2.0
"I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",2.0
"This tea is a lifesaver during cold and flu season.

"I have become a huge fan of Demi Glace and my family loves it as well.  It is expensive, but once you learn to make sauces with it you will win a lot of fans.  I am nothing more than a father that cooks when I get home from work so I have no expertise other than what I have learned over the years feeding kids.  However, once I started using Demi Glace to make sauces with chicken, pork and beef it brought a flavor to meals that I only had when dining out at more expensive places.  I love the Roasted Chicken and the De Viande Gold for just about everything I cook.  My wife loves my sauces just for dipping bread. I seldom ever see a bad review for any Demi Glace product and if there is a bad review I believe the person using it just doesn't take the time to learn how to cook with it.  The internet has many recipes for these products.  I think the easiest of the recipes are sometimes the best tasting.  Also don't worry about shelf life.  Unopened it will last a long time and when kept in the fridge it will last up to 6 months.",1.0

It's not too hot, but has heat, and it's just plain yummy. Can't seem to find it in stores.

"I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional ""full pot"" method of ""1 per person and 1 per pot"" (and for me, often ""1 extra just for the fun of it"") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them.",1.0

"I'm on a diet and there are times when I just want something crunchy. But I also have high blood pressure so a lot of snacks that I use as a treat are too high-sodium for me. I eat rice cakes with peanut butter or cottage cheese once in a while and I happened to see Popchips on Amazon.com. These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?",1.0

"I must say, I am an apple juice fan. My usual brand is Very Fine, which is your standard 100% apple juice, nothing fancy. I picked up Izze Sparkling Juice and can honestly say, I really liked it. It is carbonated, is ""sparkling"", which sets it apart from most other juices.<br /><br />At first, I wasn't completely taken with the carbonation/sparkling aspect. For one thing, it seemed particularily carbonated. I mean - WOW, bubbly! Once you get passed the inital surprise with a sparkling juice, the flavor really takes over.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the ingredients listed (in order) are : White Grape, Apple and Lemon Juice.<br /><br />I guess it's the White Grape and Lemon that give this drink it's little kick of flavor, which pushes it beyond your average apple juice.<br /><br />Because there is no extra refined sugar added, the calorie and sugar gram count come in below Very Fine, which is a good thing, and importantly, taste is not sacrificed.<br /><br />On a side note, and really kind of cool, the Izze company is very eco-friendly. Their offices are powered by the wind, they do the ""bike to work"" thing, and support recycling efforts. It's nice to see a Company giving something back and trying to make a difference in the world.",1.0

You might end up with some sort of gravy.<br /><br />Bottom line, it is interesting alternative to quinoa that mixes well with milk or can be eaten as oatmeal substitute for breakfast.

The Mexican beans that I ordered from Arizona Vanilla Co. came from a company called Halal Everyday. Halal means lawful or clean according to Islamic law. I am not Muslim and feel that failing to disclose the fact that food/food products are prepared according to religious laws that I do not accept is a fraud. Arizona should state that their products are Halal for the benefit of all their customers Muslim and non-Muslim.,0.0
"These raspberry flavored bars aren't particularly great to me.  I was never sure if they were made by the same company responsible for fruit roll ups or just a knock off but either way, the taste is really similar.  Perhaps the only difference is that these bars have a stronger raspberry taste.  I don't really like the taste that much however.  I'd rather eat raspberries straight off the vine.  However my family likes them so I will give these raspberry-flavored bars a fair review and a purchasing recommendation based on their tastes.",1.0
"My impression of Irish Breakfast has always been mostly Assam, sometimes blended with Ceylon, but never Keemum. English breakfast usually has that smokey leaf, but not Irish. This tea was smokey. If you are like me, and you don't like that smokey flavor, you won't like this one. I really didn't like it and would not recommend it to anyone who's serious about tea. Go for Harney & Sons...it's worth the extra cost.",0.0
"This product would be excellent tossed with noodles and/or salad, or baked in casserole.  So far I've used it in salmon tacos and also added it to artichoke dip on crackers.  Both times the dish was excellent.  It would also be good with scrambled eggs... anything in which you would want and pre-flaked consistency to your salmon.  Not too salty, not too oily, feels very nourishing, yum.<br /><br />I point out the consistency because I was hoping this would be more of a trail-side snack/ finger-food kind of thing based on the tags reviewers had given it.  It is not jerky.  It definitely needs to be eaten with a utensil.  If you had no utensil, you could eat it with chips/crackers if you had a bowl in which to dip it, or a tortilla and you can pour it onto the tortilla. It's very good on both.  But I would only eat it with my fingers if I was starving and desperate, because it is not finger-food consistency.  So you know, prepare to have a vector for this food.  Lolz.  Maybe not good for day hikes, but great for camp sites.  Also great in the pantry for surprise guests.<br /><br />P.S. _ I have only opened one pack out of the four packs so far, but if that is representative - not one single bone or any kind of skin/gristle or foreign object was found and you can see pieces of salmon fat which are so good and healthy for you to have in the unadulterated state...

I believe firmly in buying American for a number of reasons and none of them are political ( will most of them anyway)l. More of us, I believe, should think this way in order to produce more jobs in our country and not depend on other countries, and whatever their sanitary conditions dictate which could be very much unlike the FDA standards in America. I also believe that Amazon.com should stipulate where each product is made and not the double talk about "" packaged in Canada"" which could mean purchased in China and then packed in Canada. The only way to improve our country is to rely on Americans to produce products, receive the rewards of their labors and stabilize the economy-now that may be political but it's the damn truth.",0.0
"Before I got my puppy, I was collecting plastic bags (instead of using my reusable cloth bags) from grocery stores to pick up my puppy's poop.  I refuse to be one of those people who think that dog poop will melt into the sidewalk after a certain period of time.  I also do not want to be blamed for starting the next Black Plague if dog poop could start a plague like that.<br /><br />In comes this `bags on board' bone thing stocked with bags for like $4.  I'm thinking, ""Well, $4 is less than the price of a Bacardi and Diet...why not?!""  Man.  I am not looking back.  For some reason, my puppy pooped her way through all 30 bags in a little over a week.  Good for her... I guess?  So I had to re-up.  I almost went with stuffing plastic grocery bags in the bone and then decided that $7 was worth 120 convenient poop bags.  They fit perfectly into the bone.  The bone is not bothersome on the leash.  And, most important, I never forget a bag!  I don't really care about the colors and I don't see a quality difference between these and the `regular' blue bags.  The bags are not super thick, but my fingers have not broken through the plastic and poop has not come through the plastic.<br /><br />I am conscious of the destruction waste causes.  I do recycle.  I do wish that these were biodegradable.  But, instead of collecting the big grocery bag plastic bags, I am going to use these smaller bags for poop and my cloth bags for groceries.  Right now, the bags are a little big for my puppy, but I am sure she will grow into them...gross.",1.0

"I've had a number of instant drink packet mixes in the past from various vendors.  This, Lipton Iced Green Tea mix, is similar in the fact that it comes in a box of 10 packets, each ready to mix into a 16.9 oz. bottle of water or a like-sized glass of water.  I used it in a glass, stirring with a spoon, and it dissolved quickly for me.  I found it to be quite strong even with added ice, and ended up adding more cold water to suit my taste. I thought the flavor was good.  I could taste the honey, blackberry, and pomegranate flavors but found it was a bit overly sweet, and this comes from a confessed sugar junkie. Still, I enjoyed it after adding the water and would choose it again.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, a serving is only 8 ounces, though you mix each packet in a 16~oz. bottle of water.  I can't imagine what the purpose of making this distinction is, other than to qualify the ""5 calories per serving"" claim on the front of the box.  Would 10 calories a serving be a deal breaker for most people?<br /><br />There are no other noted nutrition values besides 1 gram of sugar and 10 mg of caffeine per serving.  It states that each 8 ounce serving contains 60 milligrams of flavonoids, which is more than cranberry juice and almost twice that in orange juice.  From an internet reference, ""Flavonoids have antioxidant activity. Flavonoids are becoming very popular because they have many health promoting effects. Tea flavonoids have many health benefits. Tea flavonoids reduce the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, lowers the blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.""<br /><br />To summarize, I enjoyed this drink and would purchase it again.  It is convenient, tasty, and provides a few health benefits.",1.0

Great for those of trying to cut down on, or abstain from, regular pasta.

"My dad got an assortment of these to give as a silly little Christmas gift for us (we are adults now).  I really wasn't expecting much from them, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are mild, but good tasting and not sickly sweet.  Similarly, the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gut-busting feeling you get from drinking soda.  I was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar or aspartame.  The only drawback is the sodium content (contained in the compounds that create the carbonation.)  One other thing to note is that one tablet is for 6 ounces of water, so you will likely need to use 2 or 3 tablets for a ""normal"" glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that if you are a soda drinker, you will find these disappointing since the flavors and carbonation are mild.  However, as an alternative to Crystal Lite, Kool-Ade (which I can't stand) or plain water, these are fun and make a good drink.",1.0

I ended up transplanting of the seedlings from the side that germinated to the other side.<br /><br />Within a couple weeks, the pump started rattling.

They also recommended that we switch from tap water to some sort of bottled water.<br /><br />The change to RO water did not help the plants, if anything they really didn't like it.<br /><br />Today the pump finally died.  I've transplanted the plants to dirt, where they'll likely die.  We called AG again, and they said that a pump had been sent and that they would send us another salsa garden kit.<br /><br />To make matters worse, when I tried to pull the pump out following the directions in the manual (I was cleaning out the basin so it wouldn't stink), the pump cover broke!<br /><br />Ugh!<br /><br />Now I'm using the grow light to help sprout some new seeds to plant outside in my garden.

"While I didn't like this flavor as well as the black cherry, it was still quite good.  Had a nice fruity taste and not overly sweet, probably because there is no added sugar.  You won't miss the sugar and neither will your kids.  This is a good alternative to regular soda for the kids because it doesn't have all the additives that soda does.  It's basically carbonated fruit juice.  It's 100% juice, so you get a nice dose of Vitamin C (100% daily allowance according to the can).  Adults will enjoy it too.  The can is 8.3 oz., which is smaller than a 12-oz soft drink, but it is just enough to satisfy your soda craving, without filling you or your kids up too much.  Sugar is sugar whether naturally occurring in juice or added, so these are not health drinks, but are great alternatives to the much more sugar and additive laden sodas.",1.0

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!",2.0

Okay, so reading their website it says these are not for eggs, fine, no more easter eggs, but what about coloring hard boiled eggs for kids' bentos?  Nope, the colors do not stick to a peeled egg either.  And it did not matter how much vinegar I used either.  Okay, so, moving on to frosting, no matter how much you add the frosting is always pastel, okay, fine, no real biggie, but the red comes out like a brick red color, really quite orangish, and I couldn't get a good a pink or purple because of it.  I guess I should have put the stuff in the fridge because it does not last well either.  I will definitely be looking for an alternative naturally colored food coloring, until then I am relegated to nothing more than using the blue to make the kids' scrambled eggs green a la Seuss.",1.0
I purchase this popcorn at Costco every chance I get.  I was glad to see it at amazon for such a great price.  This popcorn is always very good and fresh.<br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because my favorite cheese popcorn is a little more cheesy and stickier.,1.0

"Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.

"I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company. There are always at least a few kinds in there, ones that I've tried before and like and ones that I'm trying out for the first time. I finally got around to trying Kind Bars after all this time, and this specific flavor is officially on my ""that's it, you've found a gold medal winner"" list.<br /><br />There's usually something for my picky side to take issue with, but not this time. I love that they have extra protein, as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if I end up turning to one in place of lunch. The fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that I would find it too crunchy, but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasing-but-not-overpowering crunch. Unlike their sister bars (Passion Fruit Macadamia + B Complex, which I purchased at the same time) these are not cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, they have sweetness, but I find that it's just the right amount-- you're tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along.<br /><br />I bought one box to try them out, now I'm back to load up on them while they are on sale. I'm going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety. If you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix, I really can't recommend this specific bar more!",2.0

"I LOVE liquid smoke, so do most people after they've had my steak, chops or chicken; I've helped initiate more than a few fans. Last year my local store stopped carrying Wright's, but brought in 3 new brands to replace it. All three brands had soy in them and other various ingredients. Having only used Wright's in the past I was shocked to learn that not all liquid smokes are created equal. Wright's liquid smoke is allergen-free, which in my family is hugely important. I was delighted to find Wright's on Amazon, now I order by the case, save money and get the purest product on the market.",2.0

"Pomegranate: My first sip of Izze's Sparkling Pomegranate was not appreciated by my palate very much; I thought it tasted like someone had mixed a wine cooler with beer. I actually did a double take to look at the can and search for alcohol content. By the end of the can I liked it, and by the 3rd can I really liked it. It's tangy, fresh, with no sweet aftertaste and has a cool looking container design (aesthetics always matter!).<br /><br />With a total of 80 calories per cute little can, this isn't exactly what you'd call a ""diet drink,"" but I find it to be surprisingly filling, so it makes a great in-between liquid snack, and can stave away the hunger pangs until your next meal without doing damage to your diet.<br /><br />Overall a nifty drink in a most attractive can. Don't let the first taste fool you. Izze's Pomegranate Fizzy is quite yummy...a very pleasurable acquired taste.<br />.......................................<br />Grapefruit: Izze's Sparkling grapefruit is absolutely the best drink in a can I have ever tasted. Nothing is even a close 2nd. Tangy and refreshing, its lemony grapefruit flavor is quite strong and tantalizing. It also contains white grape, apple and orange juice from concentrates, but what my taste buds remember most is the lemon and grapefruit. The Grapefruit flavor has 90 calories per can, for those counting calories, but like the Pomegranate, it's very filling, and does well as an ""in-between"" snack for dieters.<br /><br />This wonderful Izze fizzy is addictive. On a hot day cold Sparkling Grapefruit is a total delight, and since it does not have refined sugars it truly takes away your thirst, not like those soda pop drinks that actually seem to make one thirstier. Thank you Izze, your Sparkling Grapefruit gets the gold award for canned beverage in my house.<br />If you're into ""hard likker,"" Izze's Grapefruit would make the perfect mixer, for vodka or tequila.",1.0

They turn their noses up at most store brand dog treats and bones, but they love these. One of my dogs has a very sensitive stomach, too, but has never had any issues with these. They're crunchy low-odor treats that make a great little snack. They're too big to use as a treat if you're going to be handing out multiple treats for a training session, though, and attempting to cut them will crack the outer crunchy shell.  In addition to the treats themselves, I love the 40 oz plastic jar. It keeps them fresh and is reusable.

"For the most part, these are what you'd want in pistachios. They arrive fresh and tasty, for a little lower price than the local store.<br /><br />I'd estimate about 5-10% of the nuts are not opened, and get trashed. Another 10% get opened with some fingernail prying and pulling pretty hard.<br /><br />They're pretty salty, which isn't ideal, but right where I'd expect a normal salted pistachio, great for some who like salty and too much for others.<br /><br />However, there's one bug in the product - literally. I think two of the last three bage had one nut each where the nut had a bug - work, whatever it was - inside the shell.<br /><br />If you're on the couch munching watching tv, not looking at the nuts you open and eat, it'd be very easy to have eaten it. It's disgusting.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they explained 'they try but it's not practical to avoid'.

It tastes like someone took whiteboard chalk, ground it up, put it into a kiln with coffee bean shells and ""roasted"" them together until they were burned beyond recognition. I can't find the words to describe the awfulness of this product. So I'll try a different method to describe it... Some of you may be looking at these bars because they are vegan.

They tasted good enough so that I ate five more quickly after eating the first, and did notice a melon flavor, but it seemed quickly muted by this odd sweet taste that made me feel ill. It wasn't highly unpleasant, but made it taste what I thought was overly candy like and so turned what could have tasted like something pleasant, into a cheap candy taste, that was too strong and so made me feel sick. Also the powdery consistency in the middle I don't think was strong enough, I noticed more of the soft outer covering than the filling, which was more interesting and so wanted to taste that more, but it was so easy to chew that it passed into me fast and was gone in a moment.",1.0

"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!",0.0

It lacks that fullness and bold flavor that I desire, which I guess is what you're getting when you get pecan flavored coffee.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you like bold coffee, avoid at all costs.

"I popped open a 1.5 Liter bad boy after a six-mile run and felt refreshed, but it was very hot and I don't know that the refreshment was from anything more than recovering from severe thirst.  I drank the entire bottle in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />I take other pre-workout and post-workout supplements and many of them have potassium and electrolytes.  I noticed that a bottle of water from Wal-mart, bottled at a municipal plan, contains the same level of potassium as Essentia.  I down a couple of 16.9 ounce bottles of that water after running as well.<br /><br />So, I can't attest that this water will change your life.  I can't even attest that it's worth more than other waters.  pH balanced water sounds great, and there's really nothing from a taste level that's bad, certainly.  But did it impact my overall physical recovery after a run?  I don't think so.  I was less thirsty, of course, but my legs didn't spring into action any faster or anything like that.<br /><br />It's good water.  Given a choice of this water or another brand that was similarly priced, I'd reach for this one.  But I also didn't experience a compelling reason to switch from the cheaper Wal-mart water.",2.0
"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes. It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly.

My usual fare is either an Easy Mac Bowl or a Lean Cuisine, so I wanted to try something like a Lean Cuisine that didn't require it to be kept frozen.

I guess for the amount of calories per serving it's fine, but I was still hungry after eating it. The sauce is a bit on the sour side. Now, being a born and bred italian, I despise sickly sweet pasta sauce one often finds as you move west through the country, but this was even too sour for me. The chunks of chicken were laughable, i probably wouldn't have even known it was chicken had I not been looking for them and ruled out every other piece of food I *could* identify. I almost would rather not have the chicken in there at all if it's just going to be little freeze dried cubes of mystery meat.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed.

"My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, ""natural,"" flavored bones and thought.... ""SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!"" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.",0.0
"My husband recently has had to go on a ""no salt"" diet, and his favorite restaurant is Outback, so I ordered him this steak seasoning.  The first time we used it, we both thought it was very bland - the steaks tasted like they had been cooked with nothing.  We doubled the amount we used the second time, and it was still completely tasteless.  The third time we dipped the steaks in egg and used this seasoning as a breadcrumb-style coating (nothing added to it, just a bowl of this seasoning), and the steaks were STILL completely tasteless.  I threw the rest of the giant tub of colored red flecks in the garbage.  Did I just get a really old batch or what?  What a waste.",0.0
"I eat oatmeal for breakfast every day.  Nutritionally the Old Wessex brand is identical to Walmart's Great Value Old Fashioned Rolled Oats.  The price of the Old Wessex oats is $2.42 a pound and the Walmart oats cost $1.14 a pound.  So my yearly cost for Wessex is $106.50 and for Great Value it is $50.16.  Thus the Old Wessex oats cost $56.34 more per year.  The Old Wessex oats definitely taste better, no question about that.  But do I want to spend $56.34 more per year for the identical nutrition?

"Hubby and I both have teeth that can't handle anything too seedy or hard. I also lost 81 lbs (so far) doing a lower carb diet (not LOW, but LOWER). I pretty much skip bread these days--and cereal, etc--but I don't mind using up some of my starch/carb calories on these. So versatile. To dip. To make cracker sandwiches. To use breakfast type spreads on (when a craving for bagels/toast hits). I love them with hummus, with cheese, cracked over soup, topped with egg salad, with neufchatel and sugar-free preserves (I use Nature's Hollow). They are so nice to have with my breakfast omelettes.<br /><br />Even my super picky hubby likes them. We both adore the texture. Oh, man. How perfect. The lightness that preserves a nice, gentle crispness.<br /><br />Wasa, please don't ever stop making these.<br /><br />I like this one and the mild rye. Both are now staples here. Satisfy my bread needs without a ton of carbs. And since I restrict myself to 1200 calories, two of these do little damage to my eating plan at 20 calories each. I also like to watch my sodium (middle-aged and almost off blood pressure meds), and these don't pack on the salt.<br /><br />Thumbs up!<br /><br />Now, if they could make one that's like an everything bagel--an everything crispbread light and crispy version with the onion/garlic/sesame seed/poppyseed. How cool would that be? (Or maybe they already have, dunno.)<br /><br />Update: I don't eat gluten anymore, so I don't buy this product these days.

"My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to ""spin"" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't ""Paw-centric"" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product.

But, I love peanut butter but hate the calories, so I decided to take all the good reviews to heart and give it a go. I was honestly shocked when I mixed up my first tablespoons. It felt, looked, and smelled like real peanut butter! The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water. Be warned, this makes quite a small amount of peanut butter. It is just enough to coat one slice of toast, and actually, I would like a tad more.

"I'd never tried anything with soy intentionally and didn't realize this was soy milk.  I'm not a gym goer, someone who exercises much or even a healthy eater.  So why did I get this?<br /><br />I need to cut down on my calorie intake.  I tend to nibble during the day and have a big dinner, usually late because of work hours and then off to bed.  This needs to change so I've started eating breakfast and lunch but decided I didn't need the crazy amount of calories at dinner time but did need something to tide me over until the morning.<br /><br />This product is low calories (260 total for the whole 15.9 oz container) and high in protein (16g).<br /><br />As for the taste...<br />Chocolate - very rich and thick, for me just a little too thick so I can't finish the whole container.<br />French vanilla - never liked french vanilla anything but I really like this.<br />Cappuccino - I was drinking cappuccino coffee multiple times a day - this doesn't thrill me that much, I thought it would be better but it's just OK.<br />Spiced Chai - I've never had Chai anything, I knew I was going to dislike this and oddly enough instead I really like it.<br /><br />I do make sure it is cold, I think if any of these were on the warm side they would be a little less tasty.<br /><br />*Update*<br />December 3, 2011 - With the exception of a once a week dinner out I've been having this in the evening after a salad loaded with veggies and fruits (fruit in the salad cuts down on the amount of dressing I need for some reason).<br /><br />I decided to get on the scale, I am down 9 Lbs in just about 2 1/2 weeks.  That's with no exercising.<br /><br />French vanilla & Spiced Chai (the two I thought I wouldn't like) are my favorites.<br /><br />*Update*<br />December 26, 011 - Well, goodbye 9 Lb weight loss.  Didn't eat my typical salad and drink for dinner because of later holiday hours, parties and meetings and darn if I didn't gain back the 9 Lbs+.  I'll be starting what I hope is a lifestyle change in the new year.  I'm going to keep this drink for late night, try to eat dinner earlier and also make it a lighter meal.  I'm also going for a max of 30 minutes a day of some kind of but light exercise so I don't get frustrated.  Since I spend a ton of time driving and sitting at work, any exercise is an improvement.<br /><br />One test I did make was I drank one of these a few times before those late nights, parties or dinners out and I definitely ate less because I was less hungry (high protein in the drink I assume) but I stopped drinking them because I was enjoying the holiday munchies too much.",1.0

"When my wife and I first got together we had a pantry full of Hamburger Helpers. We both worked late hours and it was great for a quick dinner. Back then, of course, they had a whole line of different flavors and varieties, rather then the stagnant line of 'meat and cheese' they have today.<br /><br />Fifteen years later we still keep a few Hamburger Helpers stocked at home, but we only have them about once a month. When Velveeta came out with their version, we gave it a try. I'm not a fan of other Velveeta products, but my wife is. This product, however, has won me over. It's better then Hamburger Helper in just about every way. First, it cooks much easier... Hamburger Helper has a powdered cheese mix that gets 'clumpy' and has to be rigorously stirred in order to mixed properly. I found the easiest way is to heat the cheese, water and milk in a separate pot, then add it as a mixture when it's time. This not only reduces heating time, but makes it easier to mix. Velveeta's Cheesy Skillets doesn't have that problem... the cheese is not powdered, so it mixes in without any trouble. There's an additional seasoning packet that is powder, but takes no effort to mix it in. So cooking-wise, Velveeta wins easily.<br /><br />As far as taste, Velveeta is FAR better. The seasoning adds a lot more flavor, and when we went back to Hamburger Helper to finish off the last box, we found it almost bland in comparison. Velveeta is a bit more expensive, but the price is well worth it... we haven't bought Hamburger Helper since. Of course, this is not exactly the healthiest meal, but when your time is limited and you need a bailout for dinner, I'd recommend Velveeta.",1.0

"*****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent ""natural flavors"" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these ""natural flavors"" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor."" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as ""grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""vegetative, popcorn"".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br />*****",2.0
"Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red ""meat"" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.",0.0

This new offering from Kelloggs has good crunch and nice cinnamon flavor.  The almonds were a welcome addition.  It stood up well to soy milk and was tasty on its own.  The flavor is reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie and gets added kudos for the fiber content and being low fat.<br /><br />I did think it was a tad too sweet and I wasn't thrilled with the sugar content.  The almonds were hard and overall it would have benefitted from more almonds and raisins.<br /><br />I enjoyed this cereal and will add it to my breakfast rotation.,1.0

It seems no one really knows what it is but no one complained about the flavor either.<br /><br />It seems to have a nice mix of ingredients that it doesn't give you a rush of energy but it does keep you awake through the day. I spent half the day just sipping on a can and it really does seem to do it's job without the rush like some other energy drinks will give you. That's a major bonus for me as I really don't like that rush. Overall it's a great product and I'm glad I got to test it out. I will certainly have to get me some so that I can have this instead of the ones I used to drink that I had to stop because of the crazy rush they would give me.<br /><br />I'll have to admit that I'm impressed with this brand and the fact someone actually put out a good energy drink that gives you energy and not a rush.",1.0

"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.",1.0
"The pasta and sauce are separately packaged with the dry pasta in the bottom plastic container and the sauce in an inner container above the pasta.  The top is perforated, with a plastic film covering the holes.  You tear off the plastic film, remove the sauce, fill with water, and nuke.  So far so good.  Drain the pasta, heat the sauce for a very short time (30 sec.), mix and eat.<br /><br />The sauce is surprisingly good - like a jarred meat sauce, but with actual meat in it (or at least, something that resembles meat closely enough).  It has a small amount of spice to it - this isn't something I would serve to small children, just larger kids and grown ups.<br /><br />The drawbacks to this dish are that the pasta is coated with a bit of oil that I was unable to avoid - once done, I felt like I needed to wash my hands - I think it was mostly from the draining step.  Finally, there are two plastic containers included in this.  One of them does have a reusable plastic top, but it has holes in it.  I suppose you could tape up the holes, or use it store things you might want to air a bit (like cheese).  Otherwise, you are tossing a good bit of plastic.  Both containers are marked '5' recyclable, so perhaps you can recycle them where you live.",1.0
"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.",1.0

"I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the ""light roast"" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup. Even using two k-cups didn't help much. It's way too light for my tastes; glad I didn't buy the box of 88 at Costco.<br /><br />So, if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee, you'd like this. The flavor is good. But, k-cups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me.<br /><br />Amazon did ship fast and had a good price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Some reviews here don't seem to understand the terms being used.<br /><br />""Light Roast"" is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted. Light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times, but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor.  It does produce a `lighter' cup of coffee.<br /><br />""Extra Bold"" is a term Keurig/Green Mountain uses to describe a K-cup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal K-cups.  More coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee. The strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew.<br /><br />You can have a ""light roast"" coffee in an ""Extra Bold"" K-cup, but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I like a medium roast; a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite.",0.0

"I bought this after reading other reviewer's comments about mixing it with mayo to imitate Subway's Southwest sauce. Kind of an expensive gamble as far as condiments go, but it would have paid off if the mixture was close enough. Unfortunately it wasn't. I love Subway's chipotle sauce, but I'm sad to say that this is NOT it -- no matter how much mayo you mix it with, it still tastes just a bit like spicy vomit.<br /><br />Two stars only because I feel bad faulting the product based on someone else's recommended use for it. I'm sure there's a better use for it, and at least now I have two and a half bottles left over to experiment with, though I'm not looking forward to it. Just don't buy it expecting Subway sauce or you may be as disappointed as I was.",0.0

"The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the broth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.

The flavor (while it lasts) is pretty good but it is so short lived that I will not purchase it again. I love the fact that it is made with xylitol since that is so good for your teeth (and much healthier than sugar or artificial sweeteners). The pieces are about an inch tall by half and inch wide and they are white- in case you were curious.,1.0
Van Houtte is my favorite K cups brand. I am really enjoying this and will order it again!,2.0
"I agree with the negative review that this mix produces very grainy waffles when made as instructed.  I don't mind it that much.  In fact, I chew very slowly and keep it in my mouth to allow the flavor to fully hit my taste buds with minimal syrup.  My husband, who like most people, prefers smooth texture, does not like it even when paired with syrup.  He does like it better when pairing the waffle with a much stronger sweetener - buckwheat honey, which also gives the end product a nutty flavor.  My son, who is 7, does not like it, either, because of the visible dark grains in the waffle - he thinks it's ""dirty"".  My 4-year-old daughter does not seem to mind it when paired with syrup.<br /><br />That said, this is an honest product with all natural ingredients and definitely not one of those food-like products with smooth texture to lure you but are bad for your health in the long run.  This is how waffles were supposed to come out 100 years ago when steel mills were not around and people were eating stone ground grains and living a much healthier life style.  You can't beat 7g fiber per serving!<br /><br />I recently learned that with whole grain products, egg whites can tone down the grainy texture compared to whole eggs.  That's what I will try when the next shipment arrives.  Another thing I will try is to put a pack of Truvia in the batter to sweeten it up a bit.<br /><br />The shipping was quick.  The product arrived intact and as described.  Overall, I am happy with the product and the shopping experience.",1.0

"I'm a green tea lover and enjoy Tazo China Green Tips when traveling as its one of the only popular green teas that you can depend on in an airport or mall. However the tea sold as China Green Tips on Amazon or in food shops is not the same tea. Or rather, if you think stale bread crumbs are the same as fresh bread then you must think like the managers of Tazo.  Tea like coffee is about all about freshness. The China Green Tips Tazo supplies to Starbucks is fresh whole leaves, the tea in these bags is stale crumbs and a real dissapointment.<br /><br />I travel a lot and get to enjoy really good green teas in Asia. Americans are still learning about green tea and judging from what is available at both super market and specialty shops, they aren't given a chance to experience how really good green tea can be. Rather they are told that green is good for you and if you just flavor it right, it should be drinkable. There are shops through out America with amazing teas from Taiwan, great carefully packaged teas in Korean and Japanese groceries, but very little of this gets past the corporate membrane. The fact that we are so tuned into the art of coffee but put up with green dust for tea is a mystery.",0.0

The top comes undone and grounds and hot water go every where. We brew other offer coffee in our machine without any issues. I called the company and they are aware of the complaint and have had others. I really wish this didn't happen because the coffee is so good. This is the second time purchasing this product where this happened. It is so difficult to find a really good decaf so I am really disapointed. I do have to say that Amazon's customer service in resolving this issue was excellent. They imediately got back to me, offered a refund and are looking into this issue. Hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future purchases.",1.0

"This sausage was awesome. I remember eating the original kind when I was a kid. The Tijuana version is spicier. They taste great and don't at all seem odd in the meat. I recommend these to people who like pickled and sour stuff and even sausages in general. They aren't really healthy though. Don't eat this stuff everyday, just like how you won't eat fast food everyday; same concept.<br /><br />You can find these at gas stations in the beef jerky section. They are 1.25 a piece. I've found these in gas stations in Michigan and Texas, so I think they are pretty spread out in the states.<br /><br />But remember, don't eat this daily, I also wouldn't recommend eating more than one sausage a day if you have a weak stomach. This stuff isn't the healthiest things to eat. They just make a great snack once in a while.",2.0
A friend recommended that I try coconut oil for a patch of psoriasis on my elbow so I purchased this brand because I have used other products made by Barlean's.

"I took a chance and ordered these even though I couldn't find out where they were manufactured. I only by Made in the USA products for my dog because items made in Mexico and other countries sometimes use arsenic as a preservative even though that is not disclosed on the ingredients. Treats made in the USA are subject to stricter rules and do not contain that preservative. I tried to see the back of the bag or read where the items were made or processed, so I took a chance and ordered them. That should have been my clue.  I received the item and found out these are made in Mexico, so I returned them. From now on I will not order anything unless I find that this information is included in the product description. I share this as a heads up to other consumers. Talk to your vet, do some research, make up your own mind.

No more panic attack feelings, and for me, that did the trick. I'm not saying if you have a heart issue it's probably coffee, lol!

"Pop Weaver popcorn is a privately owned family company in Indiana that has been around for over 80  years and is more popular than any other popcorn. They produce roughly 30 percent of the world's popcorn using a specially bred corn. Their hybrid corn is grown on the farmlands of the U.S. and Argentina. They have attempted to make their popcorn as healthy as possible. This whole grain popcorn is gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, hydrogenated oil-free, trans fats-free, GMO-free (genetically modified organisms), and Kosher certified. Real butter and dairy ingredients are used. Although this popcorn has extra butter, you will not get extremely greasy hands eating this popcorn like some other popcorn brands. A bag of Pop Weaver Microwave Popcorn can be popped in approximately two minutes, and few kernels will go unpopped. This item can be purchased at discount retailers like Wal-Mart for one-fifth the cost and has a shelf life of 18 months. A ""Freshest Before"" date can be found on each box. I gave this popcorn only three stars because I prefer the old-fashioned taste of popcorn popped in a stovetop kettle. However, if you are a big fan of microwave popcorn, I give this product two thumbs up.",1.0

"Nothing but great things to say about this seasoning salt.  I have used this product in place of table salt and seasoning salt (Lawry's).  Not only do I find I use way less than I would if I was using plain sea salt, but I also find it has more flavor than Lawry's seasoning salt.  I can't really compare it to anything but table salt, sea salt, or Lawry's because that's all I've ever used on salads and in cooking.  Speaking of salads- I have also found that using Herbamare, I don't always need salad dressing.  If I sprinkle on a salad and toss it well w/ just a bit of olive oil, I find it flavors it well and allows the taste of my garden grown veggies to come through.  What I like most is that the herbs in Herbamare can be detected and tasted.  If that makes sense.  It adds unique individual flavors as well as salt.

I save on the expensive extracts and am spared the stress of not being satisfied that I am getting value for dollar.<br /><br />I am also using this ingredient because I recently purchased the Vegan cupcake book although I refuse to use margarine and shortening. It seems my tastes in snacks and sweets are leaning towards traditional Chinese recipes that use alternative flours and are hardly sweetened but I still want to explore the use of these ingredients in traditional baked desserts.<br /><br />dwt,1.0

"This matcha is awesome. I am a caramel addict, so sometimes I'll get something caramel flavored without really thinking about it, which was the case with this tea. But really, the flavors work really well together.<br /><br />The flavor almost reminds me of what I'd imagine green tea creme brulee would taste like. It's got the obvious green tea taste from the matcha itself, but then there's the sweet, creamy notes from the caramel. It's okay when it's hot and by itself, but I think it's vastly improved when it's made as an iced matcha latte. No sugar necessary there.<br /><br />Beyond drinking it, this seems like it would make an excellent flavor for cakes and ice cream. I am definitely going to give it a try in ice cream in the summer.",1.0

"This seasoning has a good ranch flavor. I tasted it right out of the container and it seemed a bit harsh, but once it was on the popcorn it tasted really good. I used about a tablespoon of seasoning for one bowl of popcorn. I think that was a little on the light side; probably 1.5 - tablespoons would have been better, but that's a matter of taste. Use less flavoring than you think you want and just add more if necessary.<br /><br />My husband also used this on some potatoes and I think it would blend nicely with sour cream or yogurt for a good dip. So, it's versatile. The price seems a little steep, but a little of the seasoning goes a long way.

The bag lists a lot of features, like Organic, No Wheat, No Corn and Baked in Small Batches, but it doesn't say why these things are beneficial. The back of the bag has a fictional story about Newman's dog rumored to be writing a Tell All book. I assume it must appeal to Newman's target audience, and I'm not in that audience.

"Pros: organic, grain free and a reputable company that gives back to the community<br />cons: my cats needed a few days to get used to this. yes the meat looks grey. but that is because it is all natural.<br />What I do is mix a 3 ounce can with half a can of Wellnes Beef and Chicken. (so its 3/4 meat and only 1/4 chicken) This seems to work. They love this combo. If I just give them the newman's, they eat but don't finish it. Out of all of the grain free beef canned cat foods, I've had the most success with this. My cats didn't like Nature's Variety Instinct or by nature organic.

"Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make ""ladybug spots and antennae,"" which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug ""heads"") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.",0.0

"I have had a ""twitching eyelid"" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied ""you have a magnesium deficiency"".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.",1.0

"I just tried Patak's Madras Curry Paste, and am surprised (but not too surprised) that another reviewer also found Patak's Tikka Masala paste too sour.

"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I find to be unappealing.  Awhile back, I had tried this hot sauce, but I could not remember what I had thought about it.  So recently, I decided to get another bottle of it in order to give it another try.  When I tried it, my impression was that it was strong and sharp, yet it did not have a pleasant taste.  Also, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider this to be a problem--it is not overpoweringly hot.  I am glad that I gave this hot sauce another shot, but it just is not my thing.",0.0
"I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.",1.0

"The only reason I give this product a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is that the caffeine level in this tea is very high.  I read a previous review on Amazon that said it was better than coffee because it had only a mild ""kick"" from caffeine, however, my experience was different.  I get a jolt about an hour after I drink it and it's uncomfortable for a little while, then it's okay.  I love the flavor because it's so rich and earthy (which deserves 5 stars).  I do highly recommend this product if you can handle the caffeine.",1.0

Its a scam that they jack the price of the only formula that works for certain children, knowing parents who have no choice will have to pay for it.  Its costing us nearly $500 a month for this stuff.  The businessmen at Abbott Labs who decided to profit off children with special dietary needs should be ashamed.  I'm *certain* it can't cost twice the price to manufacture this.",1.0

This product that is listed for $18+ is supposed to be SIX packages of SIX mini-milks, which works out to be a little over $3 per sixpack, which is the correct price. But if you order it, they will ship only ONE six pack... making these mini-milks more expensive than the big milks (which sell at 13.5 ounce, six to a pack, for $14+)! It took me two hours talking to customer service to get this mistake corrected. The person who entered this in inventory misunderstood that it is a sixpack of sixpacks... so he/she entered it as one package of six.

"If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.",0.0
"My husband has one of the Hamilton Beach One Cup Coffee makers that uses Senseo pods.  So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.  Unfortunately, this was just bad.  When I opened the pouch, it smelled bitter.  When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.

"My children (almost 3 & 1-1/2) love squeezable fruit & veggie pouches.  This product is a great way to sneak in veggies for picky eaters and a great way to have variety and meet your daily values when out and about; I also find them to be a great snack. However, it is very difficult to find pouches with veggies at the local stores; mostly fruit pouches are sold, not many organic ones.  So I went to Amazon.  While I was happy to find Happy Tots by Happy baby (one of my favorite brands) the price was not that great.  I later found it for substantially less ($2 less) at a local organic market.  As to taste, while i've tried all other flavors and levels/stages, I will say that there is a particular taste to the Happy Tots because of the addition of a particular grain (Salba).  Give this product a try and see if your kids like it.",1.0
"Yes, I got my box for free. I probably wouldn't have bought it. There are too many cereals I like to bother with one I might or might not like, right?<br /><br />My concerns were two-fold. First, would they be sweet enough. I don't need sugar-coated cereal, but I don't want to eat cardboard, either. And second, tight-woven cereals like this tend to suck-up all the milk, so they'll start off too dry, but end up too soggy. Could this cereal overcome those concerns?<br /><br />In a word, yes.<br /><br />The flavor was sweet, with a hint of cinnamon. The squares started-off crunchy, but not too rough, and they did not suck-up the milk like a sponge, so they weren't too soggy at the end, either.<br /><br />I still have other cereals that I like better, but I'll likely occasionally buy this one, too.",1.0

Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor.

It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it (although I think Cheetos powder would taste better). I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.<br />I think I'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.<br />This product was a big fail in my household.<br />This is the first Annie's product that I have tried that I did not like.

NOTHING like the dried mango you get in the 2.6 ounce packages where it is small bite sized pieces that melt in your mouth and are chewy... these are big pieces that will snap in half if you bend them.... i will not be purchasing these again, its worth the extra cash to get the small bags , at least you know what you are getting....",0.0

"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample.",1.0
"I had always seen the commercials for these energy drinks, and being the skeptic I am never really paid them any attention. One of my friends came back from college over winter break and he drinks them quite often, so I figured why not give them a try.<br /><br />These things work well, almost too well really. I've been taking them because during the week between school and work I average about 5-6 hours of sleep. When the commercial says feel it in minutes, they were not lying.

I have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful.<br /><br />I will note that some people seem to get nothing from these, so before you go out and buy 24 bottles I'd say head to a gas station and pick one up for about 3 bucks.

"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",0.0

"This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.  As a result, when the K-cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k-cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!  Don't buy in the Amazon hassle-free packaging, you'll be sorry!",0.0
"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.<br /><br />Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.<br /><br />I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.<br /><br />This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.<br /><br />BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.<br /><br />*For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options.",0.0
"I'm usually a fan of Amy's Organics - they provide a reliable gluten-free product that I can easily adapt to my needs.

It's probably free of pesticides: However, my kitchen's organic-produce-borne fruitflies are afraid to near my bowl of this; if it hasn't got pesticides, it's certainly an effective pest repellant, and I'm considering rubbing it all over my chili starved body before I go out to the mosquito clouded Weber to grill up some real food. It's touted as vegan, which isn't really a selling point for me: After the first taste of this chili has passed my tongue, the remainder of the can will never brave the touch of flesh again.<br /><br />Back to the kitchen, Amy.

"I first stumbled across this wonderful concoction in a department store in Okinawa. My buddy and I each bought a bottle almost as an after thought (it gets brutally hot and humid there) and wandered back out into the street. We couldn't open the bottle, no matter how much we twisted and pried and appealed to examples of familiar American packaging! Eventually we were forced to go back inside and ask the sales girl for assistance, which she very graciously gave us, although you could tell she thought it was funny. And I suppose it was, at that! See, this stuff even transcends the language barrier! (If you're reading this, Calloway, I want my 200 yen back!)<br /><br />The top of the cap must be punctured in order to open, and the neck of the bottle narrows to a point about midway up (or down, if you will.) You can see the indentation I refer to in the picture above. A small marble is allowed to roll freely in the upper chamber, resting while upright on top of the narrow hole, so that when you tilt the bottle back to sip the marble rolls out and allows liquid to pass the choke point. We got such a kick out of this unique design that we both bought more bottles to take to sea. I still have some of the Okinawa vintage left, but I'm not sure it would still be good to drink.<br /><br />The flavor I had was a cross between citrus and bubble gum; certainly not your standard Coca-Cola sugar rush. (Sorry, I like Coke too, but comparisons must be made!) I understand other flavors are available, and are no doubt just as good. Oddly enough, I didn't see this product offered for sale very often on the Kanto plain, but I probably just didn't know where to look. Once I was living in Yokosuka I got hooked on another Asian drink. I forget the name, but it tasted a little like an orange creamsicle. I miss Japan so much! Guess I'll just have to settle for drinking Ramune until I get back to that part of the world. Enjoy!",2.0

"I have used this dog food for years.  About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.  I continued to buy it.  No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.

"I have tried more than one spice blend from this company (via grocery store and their website) and thus far, it has never failed to be delicious. This particular one is probably my personal favorite. It is a little bit spicy but contrary to what many people believe about Thai cooking, it is NOT always outrageously hot. This has a spicy sweet kick to it. I'd rate it about a 5 on a one to ten heat index.<br /><br />  Try using this on chicken breasts that you are pan sauteing. Put your chicken breasts (boneless/skinless) in a hot frying pan that you have put about a tablespoon of oil into (can use cooking spray also). After one side has browned, flip it, add the seasoning blend, brown the other side, put on your plate and season that side. It goes wonderfully with rice noodles or brown rice. The seasoning itself also goes great IN the brown rice or stirred into the noodles. It's a great way to make a relatively low fat/low calorie meal taste outstanding.<br /><br />If you like this blend, you have to try their others! Deliciously Dill is also a personal favorite.",2.0

"I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar.  Most foods that advertise themselves as a ""healthy"" snack are not really all that good for you.  Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat.  This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG.  They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber.  (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious.  They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip.  The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat.  I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip.  I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out.  I tried the Buffalo flavor this weekend and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected.  I still like them, but not as much as the plain.",2.0

"At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.",2.0
"These are pretty good, but you've gotta realize that each pack is the size of a pack of peanuts.  A lot of the space in each bag is air.  I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.<br /><br />Flavorwise, they're alright.  Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of.  They're not amazing though.  You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time.  This is very light flavored.",1.0

"This tuna has excellent flavor, and I keep several cans at work and at home. It's perfect for lunch or a snack, in a salad or by itself.  It is sooo much tastier than dry, water packed tuna.

As conveniect as the little pull tab cans are, they are so small that it's hard to get good leverage to open them.  I have fairly large hands for a woman.

An unfortunate effect of this mushiness is that this cereal will stick to your teeth quite a bit.  The Double Chocolate definitely has chocolate flavor to it and it's not TOO sweet, but I don't think anyone will mistake this for a healthy cereal.  Kellog's Krave Double Chocolate cereal seems more like a snack or dessert than a breakfast cereal.  It probably won't make it into my regular cereal rotation.",1.0

"I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.",0.0

"Strangest thing how something that is supposed to be good for you has all kinds of vegetable gums listed on the label. I guess people who drink this stuff are candidates for enemas, which is one of those growth industries in California. Do you want an enema? Oh right, there is inulin and other not-quite-fiber added to help out with the drain clog process. Do you think their added ""fiber"" makes a difference? I don't.<br /><br />And, when did the FDA allow food processors to use the highhanded and totally consumer-enemy term ""Natural Flavors"". I guess that is more informative than, say, ""Unnatural Flavors"", or even ""Abnormal Flavors"". Hmm, I think I'll go with ""Abnormal Flavors"", because that is what it tastes like.<br /><br />If you like the taste, you'll like the taste. Some products tell you that a man will turn into a woman from ingesting soy protein. This product eliminates all that and cuts to the chase by putting ""Hello, beautiful"" on the front. Well, fact is, I am a good-looking man, and I don't care what nonsense they put on these packages.<br /><br />It's the stevia ingredient that leaves that bitter aftertaste, as the other customer pointed out, but it tastes like sucralose.

The first time my kids unwrapped their bars, the disappointment was palpable.  These things are TINY.  They are also not much more than some oats (maybe) some rice krispy things, and itty bitty chocolate chips, all stuck together with a minimally flavorful sweet stickiness.<br /><br />Considering that I feel like I paid a little more for these compared to other brands on the market, it made these weak little granola bars seem even more pathetic.

On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being strongest coffee, this Marley brand coffee is like a 2.  Weaker than the old-style McDonald's coffee (before McCafe's came about).  Weaker than instant coffee.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other flavors and nuances to this coffee, but I honestly can't get past the weak flavor.  Perhaps, if you like weak coffee, this may be for you, and maybe the organic process leaches stuff out, but for me, this one's not to my taste.<br /><br />At least the flavor's not bitter.",0.0

One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3.

"I have never posted a review before, but because I am such an animal lover, I couldn't help but warn any pet owners thinking of giving these treats to your babies.  I was told these treats, Texas Toothpicks, are ""safer and healthier alternative to rawhide"" for dogs of all ages and sizes.  My beloved dachshund, Tele, began vomitting blood this past Friday.  I rushed her to the vet, and they immediately took her for x-rays, as they assumed she must have ingested something dangerous.  There was a huge, pointed and jagged bone fragment lodged in her upper abdomen.  They feared that the bloody vomit might be due to the stomach being punctured, so they needed to do emergency surgery to remove it before it did puncture the stomach or worse.  It was also clear by the size and shape, that she would not be able to pass it naturally and safely, even if it wasn't lodged.  Luckily, Tele is recovering so far, but it has been hell for me (and her, of course), especially considering I, as a loving parent, had given her this treat.  So, after $2,000 in medical costs, the fear of almost losing my beloved Tele and 10-14 days of recovery for her, I urge you to reconsider Texas Toothpicks for your pets!<br />I have seen at least one other posting about this concern with bone fragments and their small breed dog.

We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.,0.0

"****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea.
