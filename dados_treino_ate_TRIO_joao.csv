This was shipped to me quickly and in good condition. They were exactly what I wanted/needed for my Gluten Free lifestyle! Thanks!,2.0
"I discovered these at my local Starbucks and loved them. The sugar cookies are wonderful, have a nice crunch and leave no aftertaste. The easiest way for me to explain the taste of the sugar cookie is to tell you they taste & remind me of Christmas sugar cookies. The chocolate chip are good and the cinnamon are too but the sugar is my favorite. It's so hard to find gluten-free snacks that taste great and don't leave you yearning for a "" real "" snack. Buy them !",2.0
"I never rececieved the second package, only one, 10.5 oz pkg.  Neither the seller or Amazon ever responded to my complaint that I only received one.

THis isn't the first time they've ignored my complaint.",0.0

I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides ""Oh you want ALL of it!"" and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better.",1.0
"Was glad to find the product and although I had to buy a ton of them...no problem. The problem was that whoever did the packaging just threw them in a box and no paper or cushion or styrofoam bits.

"My husband purchased this gift basket for his Nonno this Christmas. It did arrive on time; however, the quality is EXTREMELY poor.<br /><br />The basket it arrives in looks cheap, to start out with.<br /><br />Secondly, the quality of products that come in the basket just look cheesy.<br /><br />Third, the plastic that was wrapped around the basket arrived shredded and some of the glass bottles inside the basket had punctured through and were floating around the box.<br /><br />This product is NOT suitable to give as is. To salvage this purchase due to lack of time before Christmas, my husband will need to buy a new basket, some extra items, and repackage it himself. It looks terrible the way it comes, and I would be nothing short of embarassed to give this as a gift. I do NOT recommend.",0.0
"This pump works great - that's not the problem.  The problem is that it makes the bottle about 2 feet tall when it is inserted.  That'a way too tall for your kitchen, or even in your cabinet.

I have brewed 12-15 cups without any problems at all.  The company has apparently solved the problem they were having  with the k cups. As I stated previously I love the coffee.  After trying the Cyclone blend I've decided that this is the blend for me.  Will continue to purchase the coffee not only for the flavor but also the cost.,2.0

"I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.",0.0

I love La Panzanella croccantini but was unsure about what shape they would arrive in through Amazon.  I have always had excellent service and packaging so I thought it was worth a try.  The first box came beautifully packaged with the air-pocket packaging.  The crackers were in great shape and absolutely delicious. I was so pleased that I started the Subscribe and Save feature having these shipped once each month.  The first shipment through Subscribe and Save was completely crushed.  There were 2 small sheets of bubble wrap for 6 packagages and there was nothing between the packages.  Only about 10% of the crackers are in a reasonable enough size to consider eating them.  I went online to customer service and found out that they can't be returned.  This is an expensive item that is fragile and is sent to you with no recourse for return when you're shipped the small fragments due to poor packaging on Amazon's part.  I wouldn't risk it!,0.0

The bottle boasts of a silkiness to the water within the bottle.<br /><br />The silkiness made this less refreshing for me and I, frankly, avoided the rest of the bottle for a day and tried it again and still, the mouth feel made it seem like a thicker beverage with some sort of starch in it.  According to the label of the bottle I have on hand, there is no starch, but still it feels that way.  Like cornstarch- soft, silky, but not something I would seek out in my quest for hydration.  The silkiness killed it for me and sent me in pursuit of a bottle of Smart Water.  (Note:  please read the other reviews.  The silkiness might not be an issue for everyone, but I am very sensitive to texture and flavor variations. This might be a non-issue for you. YMMV)",1.0

"I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning ""nosework"" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective ""nosing the flap"" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10"" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4"" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4"" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2""x2"" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1"".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could ""find"" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2"" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she ""finds"" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-",0.0

"These beans arrived having been very freshly roasted and with excellent aroma.  I brew in a French press and that first cup was excellent indeed- being a 5-star in flavor and at perhaps 4 on the aroma.  It did posses a rather surprising bitterness in the aftertaste but nothing that took anything significant away from the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />I have essentially finished the 5-pound bag now, and the enjoyment of that first cup continues at the same level as the first brew.  Unfortunately, my own style is to drink the coffee over the morning hours, and I normally do so by warming individual refills in the microwave.  After that  first excellent one, subsequent rewarmed  cups of this product, while a problem with many beans, drop off in quality faster than any other beans I have tried (of course, some start bad and stay bad). For that reason only- and admittedly my own habit that may not match yours- I drop this product to about 3 stars- it is a very steep drop in quality after that first cup.<br /><br />I have no idea how this might show itself using other brewing and serving methods.  I suspect that in any environment that does not require rewarming or perhaps held at temperature for longer periods, this is most definitely a 5-star candidate.  Its oiliness might possibly be a bit of a nuisance for some machines.<br /><br />Since I have found a few others that do hold their flavor extremely well after brewing and submit to rewarming quite well, I won't be using this one again.  If you are a re-warmer, I would try something else. However, I think that if you can avoid the heat cycling you should definitely consider giving in giving this one a try.",1.0

Such as SaveMart, S Mart, Food Maxx, It's not usually in the soda aisle either, all these guys make you look for it too, including Target. But it's worth it in taste. And I personally think that McDonald's burger joints also use this formulation in their taps, because it sure as heck doesn't taste the same as the coke in a Carl's burger place.

"This is the essential ingredient for the spicy tofu dish that is a signature of Szechuan cuisine. Don't buy the stuff that calls itself ""Szechuan"" sauce! The sign of the real deal Szechuan sauce is that it contains ""broad bean"" paste, not just soybean paste, and it has a name more or less like ""toban djan,"" though it can be spelled various ways in Western script. There are other brands, specifically a Japanese one I've bought in Asian groceries that is significantly hotter and redder (so more chilis, I guess), but this one is just fine and easy to get thanks to Amazon.",1.0

"Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it.",0.0
"Okay so these don't taste bad at all.  And given that they have B vitamins that's saying a lot.  They are caramel flavored hard candy with a soft honey center.  20 calories per piece, 33% of B6, B12, and C.  The C can be had easily anywhere so I don't consider that much of a plus.  But B vitamins (imo) taste *nasty* and are the vitamin that make me nauseated anytime I take a multi vitamin.<br /><br />Since B vitamins do help me feel better if I'm dragging (as well as vitamin D) I will take it every so often and have to choke down the horsepills.<br /><br />If you have trouble taking vitamins but you need more B vitamin supplementation these may be the best way to get there.  I'm a big fan of the sugary/chewy method of taking vitamins when I have to take vitamins so take my advice in that context.  I don't take them often but I prefer the non-pill forms when I have to take them and this is the best non-pill form of vitamin B I have tried to date.<br /><br />For what you pay for this you get about two and a half months of 100% dv of B6 and B12.  Since most vitamins cost around ten bucks for a month's worth of any of the non-pill-forms these are priced about the same as any of the other solutions.  If you have trouble swallowing pills these kinds of solutions are worth it.",1.0

I adopted my cat from a shelter and this is the type of food they fed him and urged me to continue feeding him. He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it.

This hot sauce has been my favorite by a margin since I tried it.

I add it to almost anything that is good spicy.  I does have a bit of a mexican food aspect, so if you are cooking asian food or something you'll have to judge if it will alter the flavor you are looking for.  I am always disappointed when I decide I have to use something else!<br /><br />The price is right, too - should be able to get it for less than $2!",2.0
"As far as Keurig coffee goes, you have like, a hundred choices.  If you're like me and like strong, smooth coffee, you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.  Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold, for me, is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K-Cups that tout the word ""strong"" or ""dark"" etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup, you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.<br /><br />I brew this EARLY in the morning, and it wakes me up.  I brew it in the afternoon, and it gives me that last-half-of-the-day pickup.  Give it a try!  At least buy the smallest option available and see what you think.

Yes, the cream solidifies in cooler weather, which can be an advantage. For example, you can purposely refrigerate the can, then scoop out the thick, cold cream, add sweetener and use like whipped cream. It's delicious. The cream is also great in coffee as creamer. If you want it mixed (homogenized), just warm up the unopened can in hot water a bit and shake to mix. We use this canned milk in smoothies every day and love it.",2.0

The down side was that it is generally more expensive than the It version, but decided to make the additional investment for the above reasons.

However, I did like it in tea which is my normal morning drink.<br /><br />Now, the ""only"" thing that would prevent my using this product because of its being natural is...cost... We do not yet know the cost, but since the product comes individually packed in a special foiled container and since there is already a Splenda product, my ranking is based upon anticipating that this product will cost more than other sweetners (as many natural and low-calorie products do, which is sad but true...)<br /><br />In the past, for a regular cup of tea, I would use half a package of sweetner...so the mild flavor worked for me...If somebody really likes lots of a sugar taste, one package would probably not work for them...<br /><br />I would recommend it with my noted concerns...<br /><br />GABixlerReviews",1.0

"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one.",0.0

"There is a very wise saying that has been in existence since the beginning of cultural societies, it goes something like this:  ""Of Tastes and Colors, no authors have written"".<br />Why? Because even though one always prefer to go with the majority (prevents discord and harsh rebuttals), sometimes you just can't say ""Oh I really like this"" even if you do not. Sometimes you have to walk on eggshells to avoid offending people's sensibilities!<br />I have found this to be the case when admiring art or good wine.

Don't cast pearls into swines and all that good stuff...<br />Enter Berres Brothers Coffee Roasters Highlander Grogg Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3). Yes, I knew it was going to be flavored, and by definition flavored coffee has the same reputation as menthol cigarettes (the rumor was it that they use the left overs of all the other tobaccos and create the line), so it applies to coffee as well according to some savvy baristas.<br />Perfect 5 Star rating. Now, why would any one would want to rate it any lower? Just to contradict the rest, and shatter that perfect shinning 5 star record? After all, 15 reviewers is a bit more than a couple of die hard, loyal fans of the company (or family, etc). Because it is not all that great, is our answer. Tried it black and it had almost a distilled and bitter taste. Covered it with cream, powder and liquid, and lots of sugar and it did not rise to the stellar category in which it has been placed. Coffee with a strong after taste, with more than one flavor that in the end failed to impress.<br />I immediately went into damage control: had different beans of regular coffees (in bean form) and grind all the beans and mix them with the Highlander Grogg. With enough sugar and cream, even chicory becomes passable, but when a coffee is this good it should stand alone preferably black so as to taste the intricate nature of its excellence.<br />WoW, far out and right on. Hazelnut, caramel, vanilla, etc., is not easy to tell where the coffee begins and the flavors end. 2 Stars.",0.0

"My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be ""sugar free"", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need ""special"" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you.

"Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.",1.0
"I enjoy the original <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z2BS"">Chips Ahoy! Real Chocolate Chip Cookies, 1.4-Ounce Single-Serve Bags (Pack of 48)</a> on occasion, but hadn't had their soft version for a while, and figured I'd give these new, gooey cookies a try, since they looked appetizing. How wrong I was. Opening the package I was confronted by a cookie massacre. About 65-70% of the package was a mess of broken cookies, displaced cookies, crumbled to pieces cookies, mashed cookies; not a pretty sight at all. I go ahead and eat one, a little mess isn't going to change the taste, right? First thought, ""Ugh, these aren't very good at all!"" As I chew, other thoughts race through my brain. Like, umm, where's the promised goo? All I have in the middle is a sweet, imitation-tasting chocolate (imagine my surprise when I saw they used real chocolate!), chewy-ish piece of food that bears next to no resemblance to real chocolate. The rest of the cookie tastes stale, preservative-laden, and a bit mushy, not my idea of a good cookie. Last, but not least, while cookies are purely junk food, the calories for these horrible cookies are 150 for two, which comes out to 75 calories for a rather small cookie (about 2 inches in diameter)! As I always say, ""If I'm going to put junk into my body, I want it to taste good."" These do not.",0.0
"Now I know that you can't guarantee how much electrolytes are in a product for certain without taking it to a lab and testing it. Since this was one of my main reasons for sampling this, this was the main thing I tested for in my daily routine.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this is good. It tastes like water and is better than the city water I get from my tap. However I do want to state that I can get similar tastes from other bottled waters on the market. This actually didn't impress me that overly much because for the most part you can get ultra-filtrated fancy water from many different sources. You need a little something extra to really stand out.<br /><br />That's where the electrolytes come in. To really test this I drank portions of this at the gym while I was doing my cardio, as good hydration can often make for a better workout. The water was pretty refreshing and it felt like it made a difference from the water I usually get from the water fountain by the changing rooms. It just didn't seem to make such an overwhelming difference that I'd rush out the door to buy another bottle as soon as I emptied this one.<br /><br />Would I buy this on my own? Under certain circumstances, yes. It's not a ""must buy"", but if I was sick and needed to rehydrate, I'd get this as an alternative to straight electrolytes.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",0.0

I called the company just to make sure that the yeast was not included in the mix itself and the ""in the box"" was a printing error but the Mama Leone's representative I spoke with assured me that a seperate packet of yeast should have been included in each box of bread mix.

"These are good! Each roll is only 45 calories with 2g of sugars. They are similar in consistency to a rice cake, but slightly firmer due to the rice syrup. I think they taste sweeter than the 2g of sugars they contain, but not so sweet that you'd consider them candy or junk. They come packaged 8 rolls to a box. Because they're not individually wrapped, they can stick to one another in the package (although not to the extent that they're destroyed). Also, because there is no wrapper, although they are a decent snack for kids, they tend to leave little hands sticky. This order was for a dozen boxes. These are certainly good enough to order more than once, but I imagine it will take some time to get through the initial order. A 6-box option might be better.",1.0

"As a red Twizzler addict I saw the ""rainbow twist"" bag in the store and just had to check it out.  I tried each flavor.  Allegedly, and even that is being generous, they are blue raspberry (huh?), watermelon, grape, lemonade, strawberry, and orange.  They all tasted pretty much the same to me.  The consistency is nothing like normal Twizzlers which tend to be firm - these are on the mushy side.<br /><br />If you're going to be bad and eat junk food like this at least it should taste good.

"I've tried several of the Coffee Bean Direct decafs, and this is probably my favorite. Smooth flavor, but with enough depth to make it interesting. The roast is a medium-dark with just a wee bit of oil on the bean. Dark enough to give it a robust flavor but light enough that you don't get a burnt taste. That perfect middle-of-the-road spot!<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct also makes a CO2 processed decaf Columbian, but I actually prefer the taste of this, even though it is made using the chemical decaf method. This has more flavor and richness than the CO2 processed version.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the package size and the beans going stale, it freezes well. I pack the beans in a Mason jar, then remove the air using a food vacuum and this attachment: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005TN7H"">FoodSaver T03-0023-01 Wide-Mouth Jar Sealer</a><br /><br />Keeps for months in the freezer without any appreciable loss of flavor. Be sure to let the jar come up to room temperature before opening it so you don't get condensation on the cold beans (I usually leave the jar sit for a day before opening it). You also should not defrost and re-freeze the beans - use a jar that is sized to hold about what you would use up in a week (for me, that's a quart size jar).<br /><br />Highly recommend!",2.0
"For Christmas, I was given the very generous gift of 6 months of Amazing Clubs ""Dessert of the Month.""  Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the professionalism of the company, particularly given how much my relative invested in what was truly a thoughtful and unique gift. The company does not provide either nutrition information or, perhaps more importantly, a list of ingredients, for most of their desserts. This can pose a serious risk to individuals with any food allergy.  Upon requesting such information,  I was simply told, and I quote: ""We choose not to disclose our vendor's information to keep our clubs exclusive and a continuous surprise for our members."" Of the six months of dessert we received, three desserts arrived with issues. We received a mango tart in dry ice that had clearly melted/evaporated. Since I didn't have the list of ingredients, nor any knowledge of how long it had been sitting ""unrefrigerated,"" I had to throw the entire tart out. We received a cheese cake in the same state.  Cookies were shipped, one month, and upon receipt they were dry, and every one was broken and crumbling. This is not to say that every dessert was bad. We got two months of brownies (which were superb) and one month of a coffee cake (which did come with nutrition info/ingredients).  Dessert products aside, the shipments were always on time. While the company offers a wide variety of other clubs to try, given my experience with the Dessert of the Month club, I would be very hesitant to try any of the other options.",1.0

"Like most people in their twilight years, I sometimes have trouble with my bowel movements. Some weeks I'll go five to six days without nary a poot and others it's like someone lined my colon with Crisco. Looking for a delicious cereal that would assist me in my problem, I chose to give Fiber Plus Cinnamon Oats Crunch a try. I'll be the first to admit, I do not like cinnamon. Its flavor makes the back of my throat ache like getting elbowed in the ear repeatedly. And while that has only happened once in my life, once was enough! It was the summer of 1942 and I was a young lad with a paper route in Terre Haute, Indiana. One day, for whatever reason that escapes me at this time, the newspapers were late getting out. Could have been a war, could have been I overslept. That ancedote isn't important at this juncture. But I was delivering the papers roughly 20-25 minutes late that day. Didn't seem like that big of a deal to me at the time as I was young and ruthless. However, Old Man Sanderson didn't see it my way. He came barreling out his front door with the deft agility of a gazelle, yelling ""WHY IS MY PAPER SO LATE?!?!"" I must admit, this startled me somewhat so I hurriedly tossed the paper in his direction and made the conscious decision to keep pedaling. Unfortunately, Old Man Sanderson had other plans. Using a shoulder tackle that would make football players shudder, he knocked me off my bicycle and into the gutter. I squealed in pain as he kept using his elbow repeatedly to knock my eardrum loose. Finally, the neighbors came out to see what the commotion was and one of them (I have no idea who as my eyes were filled with blood at this point) shot Old Man Sanderson dead in his tracks. My ear hurt for days after that.<br /><br />Anyway, this cereal really gives me slippery bowel movements which I am happy for because rugged bowel movements can really screw up an old man's day.",2.0

"I was pretty excited when I accidentally came across this product on Amazon! But --- I really like peanut butter, and how could they make it taste good and take all that oil and all those calories out? A ton of reviewers claimed it was good - but I just had to see for myself. I ordered both the regular and chocolate.  I couldn't wait to get the shipment. It came today (sooner than expected) - and I immediately mixed up the regular PB2. At first it looked like grainy stuff and water. I kept stirring - and pretty soon my spoon was coated with peanut butter - and I had a nice little mound of peanut butter in the bowl! Well - at least it looks like peanut butter - that's something! Then I tasted a little with my finger. Wait .... WHAT?? Seriously - it really IS peanut butter!! It looks like it, smells like it and tastes like it! I grew up in the mid-west, enjoying peanut butter and sweet pickle sandwiches. (Yes - sounds weird, I know - but have you tried it? Wonderful!) I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier - and those can't be enjoyed very often. I've been using the high fiber whole grain tortillas that are only 50 calories - so I spread some PB2 down the center - and placed a few pickle slices on top. I rolled up and tasted ----- perfect! I know I'm going to love this stuff! Another thing I like to do - is just scoop a spoonful of peanut butter and eat it (we call it a ""peanut butter pop""). Well guess what - this is good enough that you can even do that! If you are used to Jiff like I am - just sprinkle a bit of Splenda in the PB2 as you mix it up for that little bit of extra sweetness! I read a few reviews by people who said PB2 wasn't anything like real peanut butter - and I have to say, I have no idea what they are talking about!! I was fully prepared to sacrifice flavor for the goal of lowering fat and calories - but I'm so excited to find out I don't have to! Oh - and the PB2 Chocolate is pretty darned good stuff too! Buy PB2 and try it for yourself - you'll find a million ways to use it, I'm sure! All I wonder - is where has this been, and why didn't I know about it? I'll be telling every nutrition conscious person I know! Happy, healthy eating!!",2.0

He always wants one more.<br /><br />Baby liked banana flavor just fine, but I'm partial to the veggie and since he likes them, and I always end up taking a nibble or two, I just get veggie now :)<br /><br />The only reason it is 4 stars not 5 is because mum mum + baby saliva = cement.

"Both of my dogs really enjoyed this rawhide alternative bone. My dogs have been eating real rawhide for several years, with seemingly no issues. Recently, one of my dogs had a terrifying near-death experience; choking on a rawhide. After doing some research, I learned that this isn't an uncommon situation, and that rawhides are a known choking hazard. After the incident, I quickly researched different rawhide alternative bones, and theses ones were one of the first we have tried. They have more of a leathery texture, softer and more flexible than a rawhide. However, they are not soft treats that can be chewed up quickly, it still took my dogs some time to eat them, and enjoying them for about 10 minutes. One thing that I really liked about these bones is that they don't get stringy, slimy, and sticky like rawhides do. They get softer with chewing, and then brake off into smaller pieces, unlike rawhides that won't brake off, making the dream bones less of a choking hazard. Another great thing about these bones is that they smell really good, they have parsley and chlorophyl and other good smelling ingredients. They only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating is because the first ingredient (the most prevalent) is corn. Corn isn't the greatest thing for pets to consume because its not easy to digest. I avoid corn in pet food at all costs, but because this is a treat- and not a main food staple, I think it is okay. If I could, I would give these bones 4.5 stars. I do recommend these- especially over regular rawhides.",1.0

"To me, these taste like turnip greens and pears mixed together. I know the name of this flavor involves garden greens, but I thought the ""greens"" would be pretty tasteless, for some odd reason. You can very much taste them! I didn't care for this flavor at all. My 3 year old looked at me like I was the worst mother ever for daring to let him taste it. My 1 year old LOVES them, though! He's the closest to the target age, so I guess he would be the best judge in this case. Little ones don't exactly have the same taste ""likes"" as the older generation. (Have you ever tasted formula?!)<br /><br />I will say that the turnip green flavor wasn't as strong to me after these have been refrigerated, even if my husband disagrees.<br /><br />I know that there's the whole argument against these pouches because they aren't recyclable. I DO wish that they could be recycled, but otherwise, I LOVE these pouches! They are just so handy, especially with traveling.<br /><br />Overall, my youngest gives these a big thumbs up. If you're buying them for an older child, I'd probably try one before buying a whole case!",1.0

"These chips taste okay - although I probably would have liked the Nacho flavor better, they were 3 dollars more a case at the time I made my purchase. The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don't believe it's an isolated problem.",0.0
"If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey.<br /><br />I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India's border with Bhutan. There are only ""true Darjeeling"" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using ""milk powder"" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them.<br /><br />When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",2.0

"So I must admit that when I ordered this coffee, I thought it was one of the new fancy instants like Starbucks now has.  When I got it and found that it was pods, for which I do not have a maker, I almost sent it back.  But what I wanted it for was those afternoon coffee emergencies at work, where single serves would be perfect. Soooo - I used one of the pods like a tea bag, steeped it in very hot water...and ended up with a great cup of coffee!<br /><br />The flavor is very rich and fruity - not over burnt or weak like I would have expected given my McGyver-type preparation.

"One family I know has had a very stressful time of it, loosing a loved one last year, and having another loved one pass away at the same time another family member was getting married earlier this week.<br /><br />Having looked over flower arrangements at various florist websites online, I realized there'd still be flowers from the wedding, and frankly too many flowers after a death in the family can become overwhelming. For roughly the same price as a sympathy floral arrangement, this living sweet bay tree can be planted in a pot for the porch or deck and will provide a lasting memory of ""Grammy"".<br /><br />I ordered the plant yesterday, and received notice that it shipped this morning! How nice it will be for the family to plant it in honor of someone dearly loved. For those who aren't aware, Bay Laurel (sweet bay) is a symbol of strength and endurance.<br /><br />Update on April 27, 2012: The family planted this in a large pot on their deck, and it has now doubled in size from when it arrived. They live on the VA coast, and simply moved the pot closer to the house during cold weather nights. It's thrived outdoors in their mild climate and they're very, very happy with it.",2.0
"I love sweet Tea and I am not even a southerner.  There is something special about sweet tea that when it is mixed right, it tastes wonderful.  Unfortunately, this sweet tea concentrate missed the mark.<br /><br />First of all, the package was leaking upon arrival.  Not too much to return the product.  When I opened it, the mixture had an artificial candy-like scent.  Okay, it is suppose to be sweet.  The big problem was the instructions.  ""Just a few drops.""  Huh?  Not to be overly anal but do you mean short drops or long drops.  Is a few 3, 4, 5, or more?  Without a clear measurement, it is hard to find that ""sweet spot"".  McDonalds use a syrup concentration such as this one (I assume) and the flavor is always consistent.  That is important to me.  If they want to improve on the product, add something like ¼ teaspoon per 8 oz water or something similar.  Otherwise, if you want to experiment with getting just the right ratio of mix to water, have at it.  I don't have time and if I did, chances are I would never get it perfect again.",0.0
Taza Choclate is great but I thought ordering this I was going to receive a mix of the chocolate disks but in fact the price is for just one. Rereading the full product description I still feel this wasn't clear. So in the end I thought I ended up paying like $25 ($12 for chocolate and the rest for shipping) for two disks of chocolate that actually cost like $4 each at a store within walking distance. If I had known this was for a single flavor disk and not a variety pack I'd have steered clear of this and just walked down to the corner. Mostly my fault yes but the description of what you will reeive is lacking.,0.0
"I am a bit of a hot food aficionado.  I long moved off regular Tabasco and now need the habanero Tabasco to get a decent burn.  So after reading about the jolokia pepper I eagerly ordered this sauce, paying through the nose given the extra shipping cost. However I was very disappointed. I find the habanero Tabasco to be hotter than this stuff.  I'm looking for something to knock my socks off, the kind of heat level that you sort of regret having put in your mouth after doing so. This is not it.  Even ten drops of the stuff in a sauce on my own plate doesn't do much for me.  So I wont be ordering this again.<br /><br />(UPDATE - getting near the end of the bottle now, and I have to say taste-wise, I'm starting to quite like it.  However, I don't like it enough to pay the Amazon shipping fees, and it's not sold in any supermarkets near me, so I doubt I will be ordering this again.  Suggestion to the makers, if they ever read these comments: dispense with the labelling which makes it seem like a rival to the ""Dave's"" line of hot sauces when it blatantly isn't, and just market it on the basis of the taste.)",0.0
"As I said in a recent review for the larger Celebrate with a Crowd offering from ig4U, you start with a deep and attractive basket, then fill it (above a buffer) with a variety of tasty and unusual treats ranging from hard pretzels, to delicate truffles, imported sandwich cookies, unusual grain mustard, and number of other welcome surprises, and you have this well-stocked gift basket.  ""Celebrate with a Friends"" is a good size for a small(ish) family or modest group of friends.<br /><br />The contents are attractively arranged, in many cases they've got their own printed boxes as a presentation/organizational layer with the original wrapping underneath (which is to say that you may open a box that indicates pretzels to find a bag of pretzels within).  The basket is no Longaberger, but the one I received was of a relatively high quality construction level and was genuinely handsome.  The whole package is wrapped in plastic and then a rich brown ribbon with a card -- all in all you're left with a gift that is likely to give the impression that you spent more than you may have.<br /><br />I was pleased with the basket, delighted to discover some new treats with which I was previously unfamiliar, and in general found myself very happy with what I received.  It's worth noting that some of the exceptionally poor reviews below are entirely accurate and not at odds with my own experience -- indeed, even the harshest echo my own feelings about the product as it was represented in prototype in late October.  Without speaking for the company, my understanding is that many of us received prototype packages that saw the aforementioned original packaging represented by things like empty individual serving cereal boxes wrapped in inkjet printer paper.  The end result was, as one reviewer put it, sort of creepy.  The company replaced these prototypes with their final version, and I have gone from seeing this as a 1-star product worth (as others have) warning prospective buyers away, to feeling like they really represent a fine value.  I would have no problem whatsoever buying one of these as a gift for a group of friends.  So my review is based on the 'final' version of the product as it was received in late Nov/early Dec 2011, and not upon the late Oct prototype received.  I only make this distinction for the sake of browsers being able to consider the totality of the currently available reviews, putting the product change timeline into perspective.",1.0
"Like all Patak's products, this is an excellent high quality sauce that is designed<br />to suit just about everybody.<br /><br />Perfect with chicken, and begs you to add more ingredients like onions, garlic, peppers,<br />tomatoes, thyme, turmeric, paprika, cilantro, etc. Use your imagination.

"My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs.",2.0

"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom.

My husband and I liked the flavor, but the kids hated it.  I was expecting basically Velveta shells and cheese with broccoli and chicken and instead was flavored with chicken broth and less a mac n cheese than something else I guess.  This is most likely why the kids did not like it.  The ""pasta"" was small little rice sized/shaped pasta, forget what it is called, but I prefer larger pasta than that.  The broccoli was non-existent, it was a tiny packet of freeze dried broccoli ""florets"" that only added little green flecks to the meal, poorly done Kraft.  This product is high in sodium and calories and has many ingredients with hidden MSG in them (anything hydrolyzed or autolyzed and anythign that says ""protein extract"" or yeast extract) and it does not give anyone any vegetables.  Honestly a person is better off cooking from chicken and broccoli and adding it to Velveta shells and cheese.",1.0

Great flavor without the buzz. Or with the buzz, if we set the simmer time for a little less.

I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot. Used a blender, a shaker cup, an immersion blender - all with the same taste and consistency results.

The aftertaste is especially gross. Doesn't smell so hot either. I'm not a blue box fan, but that's at least edible at times. This one, not so much. I even tasted everything separate and checked my milk since it was a new carton...maybe that was bad? No. Tasted the plain noodle left in the strainer...that was ok. Even tasted the remnants of the powder in the paper pouch...not horrible and much like a cheese curl. So what makes it so bad when it's all mixed together? Who knows, but never again.",0.0

"Chip's Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are the latest addition to the family of Chip's Ahoy cookies.  The picture on the front shows a soft cookie gently being split in two with gooey chocolate oozing out.  Random chocolate chips, both dark and white are scattered about.  Should be chocolicious.<br />The cookies aren't bad.  There was no discernible liquid goo in the center, but more of a sensation of slightly underbaked cookie.  The texture is OK, it definitely is a very strong chocolately flavor, and overall will satisfy the need for a chocolate cookie.  If you have no other options.<br />Generally, a homemade cookie will beat out a packaged cookie every time.  So, lets just compare this cookie to other packaged cookies.  Nothing holds a candle to Oreo's because they are in a class all by themselves.  Compared to the rest of the cookies out there, these are pretty good (note 3 star rating).<br />They are packaged in an extremely noisy resealable package, ostensibly to keep them fresh.  You won't be sneaking anything out of this package, in fact, don't go looking for one in the middle of the night because you'll wake up your whole household, and possibly your neighbors.

"I was concerned about the effect ""regular"" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  ""high-end"" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!",2.0
"The Sun Bird Sweet and Sour mix packet I purchased had a recipe for sweet and sour pork on the back. I liked the idea. I also liked the relatively low sodium level for a mix. The instructions were printed in extremely small type, and I had no idea what I was getting into when I purchased the rest of the ingredients--pork, an onion, a green pepper and two carrots. I saw soy sauce, canned pineapple, catsup, cornstarch and sugar mentioned, but I always have those things on hand.<br /><br />By the time dinner was ready, I'd spend twenty minutes slicing, peeling and chopping, and had dirtied three bowls, two whisks, two measuring cups, a slotted spoon, a wooden spoon, a pair of tongs and my wok. I'd also used a LOT of cornstarch and another twenty minutes mixing the pork marinade (which called for 2 T of soy sauce, upping the sodium content considerably), mixing the sweet and sour sauce, marinating the pork, trying to brown the wet pork, removing the pork, adding the vegetables, adding the sauce back along with the pineapple, stirring frantically while the sauce was reducing and trying to judge when the sauce was thick enough. I was exhausted, the sink was full of dirty bowls and utensils and the kitchen was HOT.<br /><br />The chopping and the dirty wok go with the territory of Oriental cooking and I expected them, and I knew I'd have to make a pot of rice, but I certainly didn't expect to have to work so hard nor provide so many of the sauce ingredients to make dinner from a mix.  I wouldn't complain if the results had been spectacular, but they weren't.  Dinner was just OK. The finshed dish was bland and I added some red pepper flakes to perk it up. I must say I was disappointed both in the method and in the results. I've made sweet and sour pork from scratch before; it was only a little more work than this sauce packet recipe and the flavor was a lot better.<br /><br />It wasn't terrible, hence the two stars, but certainly not worth the time and effort.  I'll stir fry with orange juice and soy sauce before I'll use this mix again.  And in future, I'm going to read the back of packets much more carefully!",0.0
"I've tried all of the new flavored VIA instant coffees. I am, overall, a bigger fan of the traditional unflavored Colombian VIA, but my second favorite is the Mocha flavor. It's easy for me to make it in my office at a moment's notice, and I like the flavoring of the mocha--not too chocolately and sweet enough to skip the sugar. (I never have sugar around in the office, so this is nice). As another reviewer said, the mocha VIA also has great potential for mixed drinks. I'm planning to add it to a blender with ice, plain yogurt, and a tiny bit of honey to see how it works for a quick mocha smoothie.",2.0
"This us not the most flavorful spaghetti sauce although it seems at least as good to me as the case lots of Ragu that I've been buying from Amazon. If you want the top of the line in terms of flavor, then you're also going to be paying top of the line prices--at least twice what this sauce costs. And what really distinguishes this sauce is its low price. It's a terrific bargain.<br /><br />I don't actually try to get a complete spaghetti sauce when I buy these products, I just want to find a good base to which I can add other ingredients. And this serves very well in that role. It is an excellent base. To this, I typically add: pitted black olives, canned mushroom pieces, saut&eacute;ed garlic and onion, strained diced tomstoes for body (I prefer the fire-roasted ones), and either sliced Polish sausage or saut&eacute;ed ground beef. Throw the whole concoction into a slow cooker for five hours, and it's pretty good.<br /><br />These are just suggestions.

Mainstream and GF, yay!<br />-They have that dense, chewy, fudgy texture most of us love in a brownie.  These aren't cakey or crumbly.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-The mix only makes an 8x8 inch pan.  Bob's Red Mill GF brownie mix makes a 9x13 inch pan for roughly the same price, which might be better if you have a large family or are taking them to a party.<br />-These don't make a good brownie sundae with ice cream (they'll get hard) and they aren't good for crumbling up to layer in a trifle or parfait (they'll get hard and icky).  I'd recommend the Bob's Red Mill GF brownie mix again for that, or just a scratch recipe.<br /><br />A great find for someone who's got a celiac kid at home with a sweet tooth or maybe a just a celiac ""kid at heart!""",2.0
"Well this is my first review, so lets make it a long one. The reason I am reviewing this particular item is because you CANNOT return it. I had never order food (if this really qualifies) from Amazon, and simply thought if I don't like I'll just send it back. Wrong!<br /><br />My first impression was, what do I do with the liquid? The fettuccini comes in some type of brine or liquid preservative. After reading the package it says to pour the liquid out, rinse for 10-15 seconds, boil for 1 minute and then dry with a paper towel, after that simply add to your favorite dish. It is supposed to soak up the flavors in your dish.<br /><br />Ok let's give it a shot. I cut a corner of the package and started pouring out the liquid. uhh, what is that awful smell...? The slimy liquid smells like fish. I had to open the faucet and wash the liquid as it hit the sink. I had to stop half way and wash my hands, the smell was very pungent.<br /><br />I thought maybe this is an expire batch. So I looked for the expiration date and it read Nov 15, 2011. Ok, it is not rotten it is just the way it is. I got the strainer and just empty the rest of the packet in, liquid and all. I let the tap water hit it for about 30 second and took a swift, it still smell... so I man up and started washing the fettuccini by hand. It took about 2 minutes of running water and hand tossing to get all that liquid washed up.<br /><br />I had a pot of boiling water going and put the fettuccini to cook for about a minute and a half, took it out and rinsed it in cold water (not in the instructions). Check for smell and it was gone. The true test was on the taste; well... it taste like nothing really, no flavor whatsoever. As far as texture it resembles pasta in looks; however, if I had to describe it I would say is like a jellyfish tentacle (not that I have ever eating one, but how I imagine it to be), somewhat chewy and a little slimy.<br /><br />I did not have a prepared dish to add it to, so I added some parmesan cheese and ketchup and ate it like past. The verdict... it was a mediocre pasta imitation. Perhaps if I did not cook it myself but it was served to me, meaning I did not have to put up with the awful fish smell, I would have enjoyed it more. I just could not stop thinking, what am I eating?<br /><br />The only reason I give it a 3 star is because aside from the fish smell at the beginning and that, what on earth is this? bouncing in my head the entire time, I think it could become an acquired taste. Also, if added to a soup or some heavy sauce dish, I can see a potential for this as filler.<br /><br />At the end if you decide to try it, know that you may not be able to pass the fish smell and end up throwing the whole thing in the trash. I almost did. Also, remember that you may not return this product.<br /><br />Bon App&eacute;tit",1.0

"I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!",1.0
"How can you have something fruit flavored without calories of any type?  In this drink it is because you have a lot of chemicals and vague ""flavors"" that you can add to water and in one squeeze you'll have the equivalent flavor of  fruit punch in this case.  Except that squeeze needs to be a big one to actually make the water taste like fruit punch instead of just water or water with a chemical edge.<br /><br />Normally I only drink water between meals and at meals either 100% fruit juice or skim milk so I'm not expecting a sugary drink.  However when I tried a small squeeze of this additive it made the water taste horrible, a very strong and difficult to describe chemical taste.  It took me several attempts to find an amount, about 5X the simple squeeze, before the water had a positive fruity flavor.  What this means is that one bottle ends up not flavoring nearly as many drinks as it claims.<br /><br />If you really dislike the flavor of water, something I really can't undertand, and using this will get you to drink more, sure give it a try but just know it is unlikely to last as long as the package claims.",1.0
"I love carbonated drinks. Coke, Pepsi, Red Pop, Creme Soda... I think what makes me prefer them is the carbonation. Somehow, it makes me slow down and enjoy the drink more.<br /><br />However, most soft drink companies are just creating different flavors of high fructose corn syrup mixed with the carbonated water. I don't like that. There's nothing good or healthy about HFCS, and I get enough of it in the various foods I purchase without having to drink several ounces of it every day.<br /><br />This product, The Switch, is a great alternative to regular soft drinks. It's basically just carbonated fruit juice with some preservatives added. It gives me that zing I like in carbonated drinks, but without any of the high fructose corn syrup (of course fruit juice has its own sugars). It's much healthier and tastes great.<br /><br />That's what's good about this item. The only bad thing I can think of is that the cans are TINY. I'm sorry; I'm an adult male, and I can't be satisfied with an 8.3 ounce can of juice. Two cans is about right, and at the price they're asking, that's about a dollar and ninety cents to get close to the quantity of a typical bottle of soda pop (20 ounces). Is it worth the upgrade? Yeah, I guess so, but I would think it would make a 24-pack go quickly in my case. I really wish they'd just package them in 16.6 ounce containers, and then still sell as a 24-pack.<br /><br />This flavor, Black Cherry, does not sit with me well. To be fair, I'm not a fan of cherry juice anyway, but when you introduce the carbonation to cherry juice, it ends up tasting more like cough medicine than a tasty beverage. That's just my opinion, of course, and I'm sure fans of cherry juice will love it. Personally, I would like to see just plain Strawberry, and I'd probably like some other berry choices like Mulberry, Blackberry, and Raspberry. Cherry, for me, isn't the ideal choice, which is why my review of Strawberry-Watermelon gets five stars, but this one only gets four stars. Quality-wise, they're both the same; My biggest grip as concerns this review is this specific flavor.<br /><br />All told, I'd have to recommend this product if you want a fizzy drink without the crud you find in most other soft drinks. This is at least real fruit juice, and while I can't say that carbonated drinks of any kind are ""good for you"", I can at least say that this one is made with good intentions and won't make you feel like you're bloated after downing a couple of them. I'm going to ""subscribe"" to one of their products soon, just to see if I can notice a change in my weight, energy level, and general health by switching (Hey!, See? Good product name!) to something that is a bit more natural.<br /><br />As always, your mileage may vary. I'm sure your taste does.",1.0

"It tastes infinity times better with CONDENSED MILK. I used regular milk 2% and it felt like something was missing. If you don't have CONDENSED MILK.

Then add the desired amount of CONDENSED MILK depending how milky you want the tea or how strong you want the tea to be. Viola! It should be a medium orange in color not blood orange and not creamy orange either.<br /><br />There are other brands I will definitely compare! It tastes similar to the restaurant style. Gorgeous orange color. Even the ground smells aromatic like the restaurant brewed tea. Once brewed it has a slightly different aroma. For those with a sensitive nose can certainly make that distinction. Otherwise you'd say it smells the same. I am eager to get the CONDENSED MILK to get that restaurant taste down pat!",1.0

For summertime cooler...and much cheaper than the $5+ versions sold at Dunkin****** and Star***** try this:  Brew Crema, add International Delight French Vanilla creamer, and pour over ice in tall glass.  With single-brew systems, no waste & instant service!

Enjoy.<br /><br />FIRST POSTING:  I have had my Tassimo machine for 5 months now, and I am thrilled.  As a coffee nut, I used to brew several pots daily in my Farberware.  Problem is I can only drink fresh coffee!  I had to pitch the pot and start over for each cup.  Tassimo is a true value if you and your household drink coffee, tea, hot cocoa, etc. all day and night.  Tried all of the coffee blends (well over 20) made for this machine, and the Gevalia Crema and Crema decaf. are the best all around med-bodied coffee.

"If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water.<br /><br />But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet?<br /><br />Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged?<br /><br />Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.<br /><br />It is a ""perfectly"" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean.<br /><br />This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things.

"This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely. When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha, I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy, like nutmeg and cloves. It wasn't unpleasant, just totally unexpected. The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste, where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty, rich pistachio flavor. The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor, and I can't help but wonder if the spiciness isn't at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground. Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink!",1.0

"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",1.0

"For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of ""Beetlejuice"" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, ""Beetlejuice"" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",1.0

"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!""",0.0

"Guys: Although this doesn't pack the vitamin/mineral punch that Total has, this is a tasty, low fat cereal at a good price. Although it IS a processed food (processed rice, added sugar etc.), I like that it's not just  strawberry ""flavored"" bits or heavy yogurty-covered raisins and such.......it's real freeze-dried strawberries (ok, they're not fresh, but that's not a problem for me...I LOVE dried fruit in my cereal).  It's also a convenient way to get real strawberry taste in my cereal and it stays fresh.  It's one of my go to cereals out there.

"I'm a big fan of popcorn, both coated and naked, and I've always enjoyed Snack Well's treats.  In this case, they missed the mark.  The best thing about this product is that the packets are measured so you're reasonably sure your calorie count is accurate.  The popcorn itself is nicely done, light and fluffy with enough snap to be satisfying.  But the coating, which should give a sweet-salty zip to the corn, falls flat.  Not quite enough of anything and too much of whatever leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />This isn't a terrible choice of snack food, and kids probably won't complain.  Only picky adults are likely to decide that the taste doesn't warrant the caloric hit that could better be achieved with something tastier.  Plain popcorn would do the trick.",0.0

Yeah you can use more milk and less butter but it still tastes like buttery slightly cheesy slippery cardboard. If you need something in your stomach and don't really care about taste, quality, actual cheesie-ness and care more about cost, convienance and packaging this is for you. The box says it feeds mulitple people (don't remember how many servings total) but when I made it it barely came out more than 2 rather scrawny looking bits. If you plan on having three sides with your entree then have fun. Our family was not impressed. Plus the original chessiest tastes better than this crap.

"These are the new ""healthy"" Quaker Oats 100-calorie granola bars; but don't let the name deceive you.  While they may have zero trans-fats and no high fructose corn syrup, they're still chock full of other great things, like various preservatives, hydrogenated oil, artificial flavors, regular corn syrup, and combinations of fructose/dextrose.  My advice is to buy the full-fat Quaker Oats granola bars which taste better anyhow; just practice some self-control.  However, since you've already chosen this variety pack, here's the review.<br /><br />The best tasting flavors are the peanut butter and chocolate chip; the oatmeal raisin has virtually neither oats nor raisins, and tastes more like a barley/rice bar.  Somehow, the ""oatmeal raisin"" bar came with no raisins, and a much drier, barley-er consistency.  What happened to the good ol' days when granola bars were primarily oats?  But I digress.  Thank goodness there are only 16 of the oatmeal raisin in the box, and more of the better tasting PB/Choco.<br /><br />As for the chocolate chip flavor, they still have enough chocolate chips scattered about to resemble a chocolate chip granola bar, and somehow the ratio of oats to barley/rice is higher in this than compared to the oatmeal raisin bars.  The bar isn't too dry, and you feel pretty good eating just one of them and only taking in 100 calories.  Only 100 calories?  Hmm, I can afford to eat a few more...<br /><br />As for the oatmeal raisin, they're terrible compared to their low fat chocolate chip brethren.  There's nary a raisin to be found, and somehow, the oatmeal to barley/rice ratio is very low on these compared to the chocolate chip version.  If I wanted a barley/rice bar, I wouldn't have bought a product that said ""granola"" on the front.  Additionally, the bar is very dry; I think the lack of a nice fat (chocolate chips) definitely leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />As for the peanut butter, they have a great peanut buttery flavor and taste.  Not much else to be said.<br /><br />Buy these knowing you'll have slightly dry-ish oat/barley/rice bars, good for a nice snack.  They're not especially healthy, but no one needs to know.  Shhhh.",1.0
"I like to take cookies in my lunch, and I decided to give these a try since I love chocolate.  However I found these to be rather so so.  After looking at the ingredients I think I know why.  Three of them are in the over-processed or artificial category - enriched wheat flour, invert sugar, and artificial flavors.  The last is the worst to me because it screams that the taste of our product doesn't stand on its own.  While these cookies aren't ""spit it out"" bad, the taste is just off.  If you want a better tasting chocolate cookie give the Bear Naked Double Chocolate Soft Baked Granola Cookies a try instead.  I think you will be more pleased with the product, and the ingredients that make it up.",1.0

"Just finishing off a bowl (3 packets) of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar. Its very quick to make, either using fat free milk or water and then microwaving it. Prep time is about 3 minutes. The taste is very good. It's very sweet-about as sweet as the sweetest breakfast cereal. It has a strong maple flavor.<br /><br />I would not go so far as to call this a ""wholesome"" breakfast. A cereal bowl serving-an adult serving that is (3 packets), has about 33% (260mg) of your entire daily sodium intake and a ton of sugar. The sodium upper limit for persons under 51 years of age is 2500 mg per day and for those over 51 or have heart disease the upper limit is only 1500mg. That means that this product isn't quite the 'heart healthy' food Pepsico (Yes) claims it to be. None-the-less, it is a fairly good alternative to many of the breakfast cereals available and probably healthier than a bacon and eggs breakfast. It is however, no substitute for homemade oatmeal in flavor or sodium/sugar content.",1.0

"Each box contains 6 individually packaged (""Packs To Go"") cookies.<br /><br />The cookies list out at 1.48 oz each and 180 calories.<br /><br />The cookies are anywhere from 3 to 3.25 inches in diameter, and uniformly about a half inch thick.<br /><br />They do come out of the wrapper pretty soft and when you break the cookie in half it splits pretty well and doesn't crumble too much.<br /><br />I noticed a great deal more almond pieces in my cookies than chocolate ""chunks"", but I also noticed some of the chocolate had melted int he wrapper and was maybe left inside.<br /><br />The texture is good, but once you start chew the cookie just kind of come apart in your mouth, but in my experience that is how most ""Soft Baked"" cookies are.  Plus, these are oatmeal cookie so the texture is much looser, you do definitely see and taste the oats which is nice.<br /><br />The flavor is okay, the chocolate is nothing special, I would say the almonds are of good quality and flavor.  The cookie itself is sweet, but not too, with an okay butter and vanilla flavor to them.  Which is surprising since there is no butter in the ingredients, I can only guess the flavor was added.<br /><br />Overall a decent cookie, nothing special, but they are soft, and come individually wrapped so you don't have to worry about them drying out.  I think without much effort you could make something just as good at home, but if you are looking for something to throw in the lunchbox that provides some fiber (4g) and some nuts (3g protein) you wouldn't be too far off going with these.<br /><br />If you have a question feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer.",1.0
"Licorice is a funny sort of treat, both humble and old-fashioned, and perhaps more relevant than ever in an ever more obese world obsessed with counting calories.  Pomegranate is an interesting choice of flavor; the pomegranate too steps forth from the fringes of fruit consciousness as from the pages of myth, its recent 15 minutes of fame as a super-antioxidant notwithstanding.  I like licorice and I like pomegranates, but I was a bit skeptical that the pomegranate's intense dusky flavor would make a good match.  I'm still not sure--not because this licorice isn't sweet and delicious (it is!), but because I'm not sure it's really fair to say this licorice is pomegranate flavored.  Yes, there is some pomegranate in it, but it's lower on the ingredient list than elderberry.  And sure enough, there is a definite undertone--or is it an overtone?--of the somehow dark, musky sweetness that makes elderberry so distinct.  I happen to love elderberries, so for me this is a happy coincidence.  Whatever your taste may be, it does seem as though the folks at Newman's Own use good ingredients and care about the quality and flavor of their products.

"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews.

I have had the taste of the one piece that I ate in my mouth for several hours now, even after drinking some pop and going to lunch its still there.<br /><br />Please advise, even if you are adventurous DO NOT TRY!!! Only try this if you are use to ammonium cloride, if you are not, it will be one of the worst tasting things you will ever run accross.",0.0
I bought this for my dog because he takes medicine for his epilepsy and needs to eat foods with low sodium. I mix it with Pedigree's Healthy Heart low sodium chicken. He'll usually pick it out but eat it later if I don't put anything else out. I think it'll take him some getting use to.,1.0
"I have tried several Hibiscus teas--loose and bagged. Ambassador Hibiscus tea is far and away the very best. While others I tried were tart--almost sour-- this brand of hibiscus tea is smooth and highly drinkable. The bags themselves are beautiful-- staple free and silky. I decided to try hibiscus tea for its purported health benefits, primarily related to lowering blood pressure, but found other brands so difficult to drink, I almost gave up on the whole idea of drinking this kind of tea. Ambassador brand hibiscus tea is a complete pleasure to drink. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good cuppa tea.",2.0
"The Newton Fig and Honey Fruit Thin may be hard for an American to peg.  Nabisco calls them ""crispy cookies"" but the English would likely label them as ""biscuits.""  An English biscuit is the closet I've seen to this wafer shaped, very thin cookie.  They are mostly crunchy, but slightly chewy when the small piece of fruit is bitten into.<br /><br />""Slight sweet"" as Nabisco characterizes them probably misses the mark.  Certainly, many cookies are much sweeter.  But after a ""serving"" of these (three cookies), the accumulated sweetness is pronounced.  I would characterize it as being moderately sweet instead.<br /><br />Comprised of mostly pronouncable ""good stuff,"" e.g., flour, sugar, soybeans, oats, figs, raisins, honey, etc. these are some of the healthier ""cookies"" you'll find.  At only 140 calories per three cookie serving, they're pretty lean for what amounts to a satisfying snack.<br /><br />Best of all, they'll likely satisfy your kids' cookie cravings in a manner you'll feel better about than many alternatives.  No one will characterize these cookies as ""delicious"" but there's plenty to at least ""like"" about them.",1.0

"Bear Creek Country Kitchens Chipotle Soup Mix is a delicious explosion of flavor.  It's great by itself, or you can add things such as corn, jalapenos, sour cream, grated cheddar, chicken, pork, and avocaodo slices.<br /><br />When I eat this soup, I want to have about two cups of it.  There are only 110 calories per cup, but there is a problem.  One cup of this soup has 850 mg of sodium.  That is 36% of the daily value recommneded.<br /><br />Although I love the Southwestern flavor and my family serves chipotle soup to me as a special treat when I am a guest in their home, I find it necessary to warn you about the sodium.  The directions say ""salt and pepper"" to taste, but it already tastes a little too salty.  The ingredients include MSG, a serious souce of sodium.<br /><br />As our doctors tell us, elevated sodium in our diets is one of the causes of high blood pressure.",1.0

If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.

"I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great ""hearty"" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.",1.0
"My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something.

"Presumably, this flavor is created mainly for children.  So, with that in mind, this flavor tastes very good to them.  However, here's the clincher.  Don't get near them while they are chewing the stuff.  I don't know what they use to flavor this gum, but it gives people the absolute WORST breath you've ever smelled!  Something reminicent of a pig farm, if you know what I mean!  Really, it smells nothing like watermelon on their breath - it smells like you are actually downwind of your local farmer's pig pen.  Honestly, it's really that bad.  Strangest experience I've had for awhile with food.  Anyway, the kids love the taste and actually, it's really pretty good.  Just don't pop one of these in your mouth before you're going out for the evening.  People will wonder what you've been eating!",1.0
"I am a huge fan of coconut.  This candy bar is one of my favorite coconut treats.  It is not disgustingly sweet, rather it has a delicate coconut flavor.  Normally, I dislike white chocolate but with the coconut, this candy bar is amazing.  The consistency and intensity of the bar is not like a mounds bar.  This is an actual candy bar with no filling.  The coconut flavor is melded with the chocolate.  The bar is fairly large.  I typically take three to four days to eat one bar - the restraint is hard, but at 240 calories a serving restraint is necessary.  Flecks of this bar are great on ice cream but also in thicker, warmer beverages.",2.0

The box says they're ""gold foil"" but they are actually Mylar (I assume it's Mylar).<br /><br />A CAUTIONARY NOTE: There's considerable liquid in the pouch (unavoidable, I guess). It tends to squirt out once the pouch is cut. I therefore suggest opening it carefully over a bowl and draining it thoroughly (unless you like to have fish juice all over everything).<br /><br />You get either two small servings from a pouch, or one generous one.<br /><br />I'm reducing my rating to four from my original five stars, since I have had better smoked salmon. This is quite satisfactory, however, and a splendid value.",1.0

"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.",2.0

They dissolve easily and my little one never gagged or choked on these.  I initially wasn't a fan of the price of these puffs - however - the container surprisingly holds a decent amount of these and it lasted quite awhile.  The ingredients and the fact that these are organic is also cool.  I know this is lame, but I'm actually sad I won't be buying these anymore as my 23 month old toddler is outgrowing them.

"The packets make an easy and quick way to make a spicy and sweet ginger tea. However, I prefer using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029JDDE"">Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy (5.25oz)</a> to make my tea. Every packet has 17g of sugar, yet doesn't taste as sweet as Ting Ting Jahe in my opinion, which has only 3g per piece of candy. I also think that Ting Ting Jahe has a cleaner ginger flavor, but isnt as spicy as this product. This product also takes up more space and isnt as good a value as ting ting jahe. If you are looking for the quickest way to make a drink, these packets are the way to go. However, if you are willing to stir around the ginger candies until they dissolve, the ting ting jahe candies make a much better tasting drink, with less sugar and a cleaner finish. Plus, you can eat them as regular candies if you wish!",1.0

"I have been using Xylitol for a year now. I am not Diabetic nor am I overweight. I just simply don't like to consume all that sugar.

"I always get bars like this with a sense of trepidation.  They are either great or really bad.  I'm happy to say these fall in the ""great"" category in my opinion.  Here's what I like:<br /><br />They have lots of nuts, chock full of peanuts and almonds, already a big plus in my book.  Next, tons of fruit-cranberries, blueberries & pomegrante seeds as well as chia and sunflower seeds.  The bar is not overly syrupy or sweet, the natural sweetness of the fruit carries the bar and it comes in at 12 grams of sugar.  The spot where I usually get picky is consistency, is it too crunchy, too soft, too grainy?  Nope, this one is perfectly soft and chewy. I'm definitely planning to take a few of these to work and also camping this summer-they are delicious.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise these bars come in at 190 calories, 100 of the calories from fat, and 8% saturated fat,<br />Sodium is 95 mg, fiber is 5 grams and protein is 5 grams.  This provides 2% of your daily calcium, 2% of Vitamin C and 4% Iron.<br /><br />Dislikes?  Well, my dislike has nothing to do with the taste, I felt that the price of the bars were on the steep side.  With amazon's price reduction these bars still come in at approx. $1.64 per bar.  Seems a bit steep in my book, but I would still probably purchase these, maybe in the variety pack so I can try the other flavors.  If the price is not an issue, and you like fruit and nuts, this would be the bar to get for your purse or briefcase, in your desk, or out for a hike.",2.0

The paprika is brown and not a bright red. This didn't add anything to fish. It smells like celery salt. It lacks spice and flavor.  This spice blend didn't even improve with salt, garlic and lemon juice. Whatever you do- don't buy 5 lbs of it. Next time, I will buy Luzianne's Cajun Seasoning which is what I was trying to replace initially with the Amazing Taste Cajun Blend. I don't like writing bad reviews- but felt it was necessary to warn others. Amazon should really not sell this.",0.0
"I'm on my 2nd bag of this stuff.<br /><br />This IS the KRAFT cheese powder! I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it, and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags. All the same, its cheaper than buying the little round canisters of cheese powder that kraft sells for popcorn.<br /><br />To compare to the stuff in the blue box mac and cheese, so I suggest 1/4 cup of cheese powder to 1/2 cup of pasta (uncooked) -- but you can experiment for yourself.<br /><br />In terms of making mac and cheese, I suggest mixing it up with a little oil and milk (as suggested on the Kraft Mac & cheese boxes) and making sure the sauce is smooth BEFORE putting it on the cooked pasta or it will clump. The stuff for the blue box contains something to make it mix in smooth that the stuff for the popcorn doesn't have, so you do need to work a little to make sure the texture is smooth.<br /><br />It is kind of sad that the shipping for this is so expensive (over twice the price of the item itself) but thats more about the post office than the company that sells it. Even so it still comes out cheaper than buying the little blue Kraft tubes of the stuff -- your not paying for the extra packaging.",1.0
"This Tahini has made the best hummus I've ever had.  Even my Armenian friends thinks it is great.  My hummus recipe is 1/4 cup of chicken broth, 14 oz. can of chickpeas (garbanzon beans) drained, 3-4 cloves of garlic, 2 TBS lemon juice, 3 Tbs of this Tahini, and a pinch or two of cummin, and all mixed very well.

I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most.

"after 11 days of having 2 safer traps and 2 pro-pest traps out, i have caught ONE moth in the pro-pest.  one of each trap was in a closet where moths are visibly flying around, and one each in a room with fewer moths.  during same 11 days i smashed an average of 5 moths per day by hand.  hello.  are all my moths female?  do i have an amazing amazonian colony of self-fertile females?  wow.  there is a science paper in here somewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE: per the university of california integrated pest management website [...]l there are TWO kinds of cloths moths. all pheromone moth traps on the market ONLY catch one kind of clothes moth--the webbing moth -- not the case-making moth. this will explain the love-or-hate reviews out there. traps failed for me because i have case-making moths. this is probably the case for the others whose traps failed. of course it would be clever if the manufacturers of these traps declared this on the packaging, since they no doubt know it, but that would be too responsible and cut into their profits.",0.0

It has almost everything I like in a cereal, including 1)  it is delicious, 2) it fills me up (not a lot of puffy air), 3)  I feel good after I eat it, 4) it's organic, and 5) it doesn't have wheat or gluten.  Buying it via Amazon, it is also affordable (about $3.65/pound, compared to $4.69/10-oz box at the nearest health food store (90 miles away), which is about $7.50/pound).  The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that it MAY contain peanut, and my wheat-allergic daughter is also deathly allergic to peanut.  So, she can't eat it.  I can and I do.  She's jealous, because she started eating it and ate a couple of bites before she read where it might contain peanut, and she (picky, picky, picky eater) loved it.

"My dogs can pack on the pounds quickly especially during the winter month so I am always on the look for low calorie alternatives to dog treats that they can enjoy without gaining unwanted weight.  These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats.",1.0

"If you are looking for taste, nutrition, and low carbs/calories, this beverage is for you. Add to that low sodium in this particular variation and you have a drink we should all be drinking. I was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy veg-fest because of the huge amount of added sodium, but now the low-sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30% more than the original high-sodium version. Typically, this low-sodium, mixed 100% vegetable juice is the type of drink that sells for $2-4 at a juice bar per 8-ounce serving or about $8-$10 per quart from a health food store in bottles. WHY?<br /><br />There are more than 8 reasons WHY V8 is so special -- Tomatoes, Beets, Celery, Carrots, Lettuce, Parsley, Watercress and Spinach are the first eight. Low carbs/calories and no added sugar are the 9th and 10th reasons. Low sodium and the resulting favorable potassium/sodium ratio give this particular version an 11th reason to become a truly 5-star product. Also, the 17 mg. of naturally-occurring lycopene in an 8-ounce serving is more than the average amount that you would find in single-nutrient lycopene supplements which cost an average of 16 cents per pill and which are less bio-available than the naturally-occurring lycopene in the V8 juice. With all the naturally occurring vitamins, minerals, and anti-oxidants in ""V8 100% Vegetable Juice"", this is a really healthy dietetic treat as an in-between snack.<br /><br />If you are not allergic to the ingredients [e.g., tomato allergy], this is the most practical and convenient way to add a very healthy serving of mixed vegetables to your diet. This variety in a small can is a little pricey, but it is very convenient and your body will thank you.<br /><br />TASTING THE CAN????<br /><br />Some people mentioned that they tasted the can. I always pour the contents out of the can when I first open it, unless I am going to finish it in one gulp. The aluminium in the container does leach into the acidic vegetable drink due to oxidation once it is opened, so remove it or drink it ASAP.

"Last night, I visited a friend who had bought this toy for my yellow Labrador.  My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my Labrador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.<br /><br />When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug-A-Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her breakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug-A-Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug-A-Jug, so we'll see how long this treat-dispensing toy lasts.  :)<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.  I have been feeding my dog 2x/day by placing her kibble inside.  This morning, my 13-year-old Labrador figured out how to remove the end cap and eat the kibble without working it out of the narrow end.  Tonight, she bit harder than usual and the end cap snapped, just above the threads.  It's not a treat-dispensing toy anymore.  I'm glad I didn't buy this car for myself, but I'm sorry my friend's gift was so short-lived.",0.0

"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032BG3K"">Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ, In Jar, 12 oz</a> One can greatly improve upon CIB by both adding a scoop of Pro-Mod protein powder (ask your druggist to order a can) and wheat germ. The Protein powder acts as a nice minor thickening agent, but it has NO flavor. Also, to add a great deal of taste and additional nutrient value, plus fiber, try mixing the CIB powder with a fair amount of Wheat Germ: it gives CIB an excellent ""toasted/nutty"" taste that greatly complements the rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Using the CIB with the Pro-Mod protein powder and wheat germ is very healthy -- particularly for cancer patients and gastric bypass patients.

Your pets are meant to kill, scavange and eat whole foods, NOT ultra processed kibble! Yes it is more expensive then kibble....but it is so worth it.

"Please remember that DHA/ARA added to infant formulas (both non-organic and organic) are extracted using petroleum-derived hexane solvents.

Do a little research on what is in the DHA added to infant formulas before you buy.  It will be educational.<br /><br />Also, as organic consumers, we breast fed whenever possible.

"I first had Q Club Soda several months ago when I found it at my local ""gourmet"" grocery store.  It had been a while since I had had any club soda, probably years.  I had been thirsty all day, and I thought this would quench my thirst.  Well that it certainly did - and more; I just cannot believe how good this club soda is each time I take a drink.  I am not sure exactly what it is that makes it so good.  Maybe it is that pinch of Himalayan salt they put in each bottle, or maybe they fill each bottle with as much carbonation as it can theoretically hold.  Whatever the reason, this beverage is good - I mean really good.  It has become my beverage of choice all day long (except in the morning when I revert to coffee).  This is one smooth club soda.  It is so refreshing.<br /><br />So I got to thinking - other than the pinch of Himalayan salt, I really did not know the first thing about club soda.  Therefore, I did a little research.  Here is what I found out: Club soda goes by many names.  But mainly, it is merely carbonated water, also referred to as sparkling water or seltzer water.  However, believe me when I state that Q Club Soda is not just ""merely"" carbonated water.  I have been drinking a lot of club soda over the years, just by different names.  All this carbonated water is simply a concoction of carbon dioxide and water.  How simple is that.  This Q Club Soda is unique because of its maximum carbonation and that wonderful pinch of salt.  I am assuming that this Q Club Soda is so good because of the extra fizz and the salt from the region from whence the Yangtze flows.  Either way, I certainly would not want my Q Club Soda to be used for stain remover when spills occur on clothes.  That would be a waste.  I would use my Q Club Soda to relieve an upset stomach, with a touch of bitters.<br /><br />Therefore, if you try Q Club Soda, I hope you like it.",2.0
I've been looking for a nice granola to use everyday with my yogurt.<br />Hoping that the Red Mill would be chewy but it is definitely not - it's quite bland and has a cardboard like texture.<br />I definitely wouldn't recommend this if you plan on using it to add a kick to your morning yogurt.<br />Maybe it's best to get something with a little fat - but I've had non-fat granola that is much tastier than this red mill.<br />The one redeeming quality of this product is that you do get quite a lot for your money - unfortunately I ended up giving it to friends because I wasn't a fan.,0.0

I thought these were ok. Not great but not terrible. I'll end up eating the rest of them but I don't know if I'll continue to buy them. I like that they are individually packaged. I like their medium size. I like that they are soft-baked.<br /><br />Otherwise I thought they were rather dry and tasteless and they did a lot of crumbling.  The almonds were whole but small and the chocolate was in small chunks but there weren't enough of either to be a very strong taste.  I even thought it could have used more oatmeal which maybe would have kept it from being so crumbly.<br /><br />I guess I was just expecting more of a sweet taste from something with chocolate and almonds.  Adding brown sugar probably would have ruined the nutrition label but it would have helped the taste problem considerably.,0.0
"Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count<br /><br />The Marley Coffee comes in single-serving pods, however I did not have a single-serving coffee maker to test these pods. Instead, I tore open the pods and used my Frieling Stainless Steel French press. I let it steep for about 30-40 minutes as I do my morning routine and let the water cool to a drinkable temperature.<br /><br />The coffee is best described as a medium roast. The taste is very mild and actually complements my breakfast very nicely. There is no bitter aftertaste, and it does not smell or taste burnt. I'm not a coffee drinking expert, but I can definitely tell you this coffee tastes great. I usually prefer my local Kona blend or Italian and French roasts for their stronger flavor, but the Marley Coffee is mild but tastes good. I wouldn't say it is coffee flavored water, but it isn't very strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, I'm not a fan of single-serve pods due to the higher cost. It is a mild tasting coffee, so those that prefer full bodied dark roasts won't like it.",1.0
"This is actually better than I expected when I paid less than 50 cents each.  We usually use a packet mix and hot water from the brewer.  This is much easier and the taste is comparable.

I would not buy it at the regular price that some retailers ask.",1.0

"If you want to use a lot of tumeric then this is the way to go. The list of health benefits associated with turmeric is very, very long, but at top of that list must be its cancer-fighting properties. Paired up with veggies like cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage, there is solid evidence to suggest it is very useful in preventing prostate cancer (there are approximately half a million new cases of this type of cancer each year in the U.S. alone). Most of us enjoy a drink (or several) and turmeric also strengthens the liver's potential to purify toxins in the body, along with carcinogens found in the diet (bring on the steak). Turmeric is also great at lowering cholesterol as it prevents the oxidization of cholesterol, which is what makes it harmful; this is all good for protecting your heart as it is the oxidized cholesterol that damages blood vessels. The yellow spice is also an anti-inflammatory.",2.0

I ordered through a third party to receive a bunch of samplers, and I received a package of this Baronet Cinnamon Hazelnut as a tree sample.<br /><br />First of all, the pods are individually wrapped, which I think does quite a bit to preserve freshness.  Now the flavor can't compare to cup of freshly roasted and freshely ground beans, but this was pretty dang tasty for a preground coffee.  There was only the slightest hint of bitterness, and the delectable cinnamon undertones really made up for that.  I've never had cinnamon in coffee before, but I have a feeling I will be having it again.<br /><br />I have about 30 different kinds of coffee pods to try.

"(This is being said at the 114.99 price point...)<br />I'm gonna go ahead and agree with all the rest of the reviewers that the price is ridonkulous.  I got a bottle for 99 cents at kroger.<br /><br />I am going to have to disagree with the reviewers on the taste.  They all enjoyed the flavor, so they must not drink real coconut water.  Just a warning to those of us who do, don't get this even if the price drops down to the more reasonalbe 20-ish dollars per pack.  I bought this and did note that is said coconut water ""beverage""..., still I thought for less than half the price I pay for coconut water that doesn't need to be labeled as a beverage, I could stand to have a somewhat diluted product.<br /><br />Was totally not expecting it to taste exactly like something I would pay two to four dollars for.  And still, at the first sip, my gag reflex kicked in.<br /><br />Caution: This stuff is sweeter than your lucky charms from your childhood after you donated all the cereal parts to the dog and doused the already overly sweet marshmellows in gallons of sugar.

"I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.",0.0

I'm a fan and would recommend it to any mint fan.<br /><br />In addition to this tea, I've consumed several other mint teas, including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG5IZK"">Bigelow Peppermint Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO630W"">SerendipiTea Organic Mint, Au Naturale Tisane & Peppermint Tea, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and Taylors of Harrogate Herbal Peppermint Tea Box 20 Tea Bags.  The two best teas in terms of overall freshness are the Harney & Sons tea and the Bigelow tea.  The packets just keep the tea perfect until the moment of brewing.  If you cannot find Harney & Sons or Bigelow, the peppermint options offered by Taylors of Harrogate is good.<br /><br />While it is convenient to use individually bagged teas while traveling or at the office, they definitely lead to more waste. If you like mint tea and are willing to use a home brewer like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D07MCU"">Finum Goldton Filters, Blue and Green</a>, a good loose mint tea is the aforementioned <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO630W"">SerendipiTea Organic Mint, Au Naturale Tisane & Peppermint Tea, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>.  The SerendipiTea is not quite as fresh tasting as the individually packaged teas that are offered by Harney & Sons and Bigelow.<br /><br />If freshness and flavor are of optimal importance, Harney & Sons produces a fine tea.  Just know there are some other options.  Bigelow also has a very fresh tea that is individually packaged.  SerendipiTea provides a loose tea that is good and, if all of these options are gone, Taylors of Harrogate is a decent backup.<br /><br />4.5 stars",1.0

"Finding this product on Amazon was like finding an unexpected Christmas present!<br /><br />Highly recommend by the vet, because of price, I save it for special occasion (always once a day) and, by far, the treat my dog just loves.  True story.  Since I am not able to walk my dog, when the mail lady delivers my mail, she often leaves screen door  open so Scrappy can take off and run for exercize.  She leaves screen door open, whe he has been out running when he should be back, the mail lady hollers ""Greenie, greenie"" and this 15# of black fur runs full speed ahead, into the patio and the door inside (which I left open.

I have always enjoyed this flavor of popchip and they are highly addictive.  Which makes the money saving 24 pack such a deal.  The problem with the the 3 oz. is that you eat them until your in a coma and the rest go stale.  The 1 oz. allows you to stop sooner without wasting good food.  I don't like the extra bags to through away but the 3 oz wastes food and money.  I actually found that at the time I purchased these the 24 x 1 pack here was cheaper than the 12 x 3 pack.  My only hope would be that they introduce a larger resealable for less.  These chips with their simple salt and pepper flavour go with almost everything.  So enjoy.  Bonn Appetite!,2.0

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",0.0

"""illy issimo"" Cappuccino Coffee Drink looked like an interesting beverage when I was sent a sample can as part of Amazon Vine.  However when I tried it I found it was OK but a bit weaker than I would have wanted.<br /><br />Note that this is a sweetened beverage - and of course nothing bearing a semblance to an authentic cappuccino served at a restaurant of coffee house.  But I appreciate the fact that it was only moderately sweetened, much less so than sweetened coffee drinks you might find at a McDonalds or convenience store.  I also like that only a small amount of cocoa was added, preventing the drink from starting to resemble chocolate milk.  Unfortunately, there was also too little coffee flavor my taste.  I really wanted to taste at least some roasted flavor in the drink, but there was little to none of this.<br /><br />For those who want a mild lightly sweet coffee drink, illy issimo Cappuccino is certainly worth a try.  But your in search for a bolder taste then you may be a bit disappointed with this product as I was.",1.0

My weaning 2-year-old rejects all other animal and non-dairy milk. This is the only rice milk she asks for. It does not have canola oil listed as an ingredient which I appreciate. I also love that it is organic and brown rice. But I must take back one star because I tried twice contacting the company regarding the level of lead in their rice used for this product. They never replied and it seems the only contact for the company is the president's lawyer which doesn't look good. Also I found a violation against them for representing a product as organic when it was not. I could not find any details on this violation. My confidence in the product was so shaken I ended up tossing my last 12-pak of it until I can find more information on WHERE the rice comes from and how MUCH lead it contains before I give it to my toddler. I was looking for a post-Fukushima alternative to milk since that is still radioactive on the west coast but I have not found a substitute so I have gone back buying pre-Fukushima powdered milk which is a chore to mix.,1.0

Oh, and I noticed that you made them substantially smaller which in this case is a good thing because I can't imagine anyone choking their way through the entire bar anyway. I'm not sure who authorized this farce, I mean product change, and wonder if they actually tasted they product prior to forcing it out onto unwitting consumers like me.

"I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!",1.0
"I saw an add on TV for these and then read some reviews on the net (some good some bad). I bought a case of these and wish I hadn't.

Saw a statement about them as I reviewed today (in ""product features"" it says, ""Please note: 'regular', 'bold' and 'extra bold' refer to the amount of coffee in the K-Cup""). There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.<br /><br />So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).<br /><br />Very, very disappointed!<br /><br />PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was ""Light Roast"".

"Like another reviewer, we tried the brownies first and were in heaven, so we assumed the chocolate chip cookies would be just as good.  Boy were we wrong!  I had to add tons of vanilla to the dough to get rid of the bitter taste, but even that just slightly masked it.  Once they baked up they tasted better but they were still a far cry from a good chocolate chip cookie.  They can hardly be called chocolate chip cookies with how little ""chocolate"" is in them (carob).  Don't waste your time with this mix and make Alton Brown's gluten free cc cookies instead!

"DESCRIPTION<br />The product is actually a mostly-sugar syrup with black specks of ground vanilla beans.  I expected a more intensely ""vanilla"" product than ""extract"", but the ""paste"" is actually less intense.<br /><br />EQUIVALENCES<br />According to the label: ""1 Tbs. vanilla paste = 1 Tbs. vanilla extract = 1 vanilla bean"".  In reality, my guess is that the paste is about half the strength of ""extract"".  Caveat, the alchohol in vanilla extract is probably a substantial portion of the vanilla-ish flavor in ""extract"".<br /><br />USING<br />Like any syrup, it is slow to mix with cold ingredients or in cold water.  It generally requires warming or vigourous mixing to mix uniformly.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO ""EXTRACT""<br />> ""Extract"" is vanilla flavor in alchohol. ""Paste"" is ground vanilla in sugar syrup. In my limited experience, ""extract"" is more intensely ""vanilla"" but the alcohol flavor interferes with use in uncooked (or lightly cooked) desserts---for example, in home-made ice-cream, or in a glass of vanilla-milk, or pudding.<br />Example: I make a faux-chocolate pudding with a tropical fruit called ""black sapote"", milk, Knox Gelatin <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQTD2"">Knox Original Gelatin (32-Count Envelopes), Unflavored, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, sugar, and vanilla (extract).  I've always used Massey vanilla extract, but the alchohol flavor detracts from the chocolate flavor.  I look foward to trying the paste for this purpose.<br />> The ""paste"" has the advantage of not evaporating (which can happen to extract kept for a year or two).<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Use ""extract"" for deserts which will be substantially cooked (enough to drive the alchohol off).  Use ""paste"" for uncooked (or lightly cooked) deserts.",1.0

"I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware.",0.0

"This seed grain's subtle taste, meaty texture, and low glycemic index make it a healthful alternative to rice or wheat.

"We have completely replaced white sugar in our home, and Agave Nectar is one of the things we have used to do it.  We use it in baking (although this gets expensive, so sometimes we use organic evaporated cane sugar instead), for syrup (I don't buy or make syrup anymore), on PB&J's, on top of cold cereal or hot oatmeal, etc.  Agave is actually GOOD for you, as it is high in minerals.  In addition, it is low on the glycemic index, so it does not raise your blood sugar levels.  I have been off of white sugar and corn syrup for over a year, so I can tell immediately if something is high in sugar of any form.  Agave does not give me that feeling, so I know it is not affecting my blood sugar level.  I love this stuff, and this subscription on Amazon is the best price around for the good quality Agave.

"I'm an olive addict - it's officially a sickness. Granted there was only one review for the product but the line got good reviews in general. What a letdown. Received three jars, opened one and olives were mushy with an odd ""off"" taste. Second jar was same, off taste, smell and mushiness. I almost threw third jar away unopened but I'm stubborn and I paid a lot for these damn olives! Finally, a decent olive - not great but some proper olive taste, nice brine and crispness. For the cost/shipping I feel ripped off. It's like they sent two bad jars and one good. I won't ever order these from Amazon again. In fact Gristede's carries Mezzetta Martini olives and the olives and Vermouth are really delicious - not a mushy one in the bunch and the liquid makes a great dirty martini. Best, a case of six was less than this order. I've got my fingers crossed they won't be mushy when they arrive. I think the vinegar and vermouth softens the Leone olives - the Mezzetta olives are as sans vinegar. If you love olives give the Mezzetta's try.",0.0

"In 2010 I have been in London (UK), and bought in  a grocery store PG tips loose tea. It has been labeled ""Rainforest Alliance CERTIFIED minimum 50%  certified content"". It was  The GREIT TEA!

The tea I ordered on Amazon.com in September of this, 2011 year, came in very similar but not exactly the same boxes, without certification, and with taste and aroma of the cheapest assan tea.<br />Overall, I like sop on Amazon.com, and will be very appreciated  if you help me to find source to buy the real (certified, english) PG tips loose tea.

"The ingredients and ease of preparation are great, but it's just too bland. To me, it's inedible without adding salt and hot peppers of some sort.  I didn't have a problem with the texture, and the ingredients are great.  But I can't recommend it because of the underwhelming taste.",1.0
"I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause.

I have been buying Australian Crystalized Ginger from Sweet Energy company for a long time.  Very tasty product but ridiculously expensive.  I therefore decided to give the current item a try.  It is a haphazard mix of good and bad pieces.  But what is very curious is the texture and substance of each piece.  If I could take a wild guess I would say that these pieces seem to be mashed ginger blended with sugar then compacted and molded into solid feeling coins.  On the outside too there is entirely too much sugar.<br />All in all this product is not up to par.,0.0

"My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.<br /><br />I gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away.  As far as I'm concerned, these deserve two paws up.  My housemate Tiger, also enjoyed the Bites.  She has a more discriminating palate than me, but she liked these just fine.  We think they compare favorably to other feline brand  snacks, like Pounce and Temptations.  Each piece is larger than say, a Pounce pellet, which our human broke into smaller pieces, so one or two make a more than adequate snack.<br /><br />According to my human, the package says that the treats are grain-free and are made from ""minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients.""  Ingredients include chicken, turkey, vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli, ground flaxseed, salmon oil, and mixed tocopherols with citric acid (?).  I'm not entirely sure what all that stuff means, but I would recommend the Bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats.",1.0

"I requested this after trying the shampoo and conditioner lines which I'd been moderately pleased with.  I thought--and hoped this might follow suit.  I have very fine, dry flyaway hair that is a pain to control.  I often use some form of anti frizz or hair product to tame it smooth.<br /><br />That said, I used this for the first time getting ready for a wedding.  I figured a little smoothing and shine wouldn't be too bad.  I used a tiny amount of it, but the results were still awful.  My hair looked like I'd slimed it--hanging in wet looking clumps.  I had to grab an emergency shower prior to the wedding and really scrub to get the product out completely.<br /><br />It's possible I used this product wrong, or that it just isn't intended for my type of hair--but there's nothing on the container that states how to use this product, or that it's meant for a particular hair-type.

"We use this bouillon to add to our meals for multiple reasons.  Whether it is chicken of beef flavored it adds flavor to your meal without adding fat and provides an ideal bouillon to use to make gravy with or to use as a basting sauce to roast or broil your meat in.  You are buying all the flavor and you add your own water to make it as concentrated as you would like.  You can dissolve the bouillon powder in hot water and pour it into your food to cook it or simply stir it in without any water at all. You can even add it to vegetables to get a beef or chicken flavor added to them.<br /><br />This is great tasting, fast to make, and it is made by Hormel.  It contains only 2 carbs, 1 sugar and 1 protein per serving.  But here is the best part, it is:<br /><br />* Gluten free<br />* Sodium Free<br />* MSG Free<br /><br />If you are on a low salt and low fat diet then this is the ideal product for you. We use it all the time and it tastes good and we like the benefits that it brings to our meals as far as added flavor without some of the negative factors that you can get with other brands.  It lets you use less oil and butter while cooking and still make a tasty meal.  We like this product and we believe you will to.",2.0

And one of the K-cups had come open, reducing the quantity to 46 and creating a mess of coffee grounds in the box.

I suppose if many others are experiencing this same issue, it may be time to choose another coffee provider.<br /><br />March 29 Update: Discovered 8 other faulty cups in this batch - Top seal would come loose while brewing & cause grounds to overflow from top of K-cup, or the internal filter would leak by and puke coffee grounds into my cup.  I was beginning to suspect a faulty brewer,but when these same results occurred on a second and third brewer, the problem lies in the K-cup...",1.0
"I love hazelnuts and hazelnut spreads, or so I thought. But it seems that the competition is still far behind Nutella in getting the right taste.

"With Tahitian vanilla and a great name (Beanilla), I had high expectations for this product. Alas, it doesn't taste like vanilla and barely even smells like vanilla.  It smells like cheap candy:  a sickening starchy sweetness, almost like Play-Doh mixed with confectioner's sugar, with a hint of McDonald's vanilla shake.  The product melts in your mouth (good), but tastes like sweet powdered clay.<br /><br />I keep the Beanilla in my cupboard and retry it periodically, hoping that my taste buds were off in the past.  But, whether sprinkled on coffee (the main reason I purchased the product) or mixed into icecream, the product is gross.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm not using it as intended or am not thinking of it the correct way.  If you think of it as a powdered creamer like Coffee-Mate (and you like Coffee-Mate), you might like it in coffee.  It might also be better in baked goods (on the label it recommends using the product for ""frosting, sauces, puddings, and other recipes as a substitute for vanilla extract"").  Liquid vanilla extract contains alcohol and slightly thins what you're making -- I see an advantage in using a powdered vanilla if you want to avoid these characteristics.<br /><br />I'm giving the product a chance and want to like it, but it's the most artificial tasting real vanilla I've had.  I purchased the 12oz. version.  If you think you'd like to try it, I'd advise trying the 4 oz version first.<br /><br />Ingredients on the Label:  ""Dextrose, Silicon Dioxide, Vanilla Bean Extractives""<br /><br />I recommended ""Authentic Foods Vanilla Powder,"" also sold here on Amazon for a more genuine vanilla taste.  It's made with:  ""Natural Vanilla Bean Extractives, Evaporated Cane Juice, Silica, Cellulose.""  I like this for icecream and for coffee drinks.<br /><br />You might also use Raw Vanilla Bean Powder, which is expensive at triple to quadruple the price, but it contains only vanilla.",0.0

"When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in ""pods"". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod.",1.0

"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />""cocoa.""

I've never tried the Celtic Sea Salt before but have read a lot about it being better than regular salt for you.  I bought this and am very pleased except that I believe I would have preferred to have bought the fine ground.  This works great for cooking but you need a grinder to use at the table.  Tastes just like salt.  I can't tell any difference in taste from the iodized table salt.  It definitely looks different.  It's a moist gray color.  Very pleased.

"The first thing I noticed about this cereal was the unpleasant smell coming out of the bag.  It was a bit like the little wood chips you put in pet cages.  I tried an O and was underwhelmed.  It tasted more or less like the weird smell, but with a strange sweetness that manages to register as ""sugar"" on the tongue but not add any flavor to the Os.  Honey?  Nut?  No, none of that.  Just woodsy grains and a separate aftertaste of sugar.<br /><br />I tried a bowl with milk.  The texture is interesting, bigger, fluffier and crispier than Cheerios.  Maybe a bit more like Apple Jacks (or how I remember Apple Jacks to be).  To be fair, the longer you let it sit in the milk, the better it becomes.  (Not much.  Just a smidge.)  This is probably because the milk gives it some kind of a flavor.  But that flavor is still not honey nut.  Before the milk sets in, It's bland and a little bitter, kind of like plain shredded wheat, and afterwards it's only slightly sweeter.  The bitterness is still prominent.<br /><br />To be fair, I suppose, I'm not sure what I was expecting.  I've tried a lot of Glutino products and to say they've been ""hit or miss"" would be an overstatement.  Mostly they've been ""miss"" or merely ""edible.""  A lot of them suffer from blandness, and several of them have this same weird ""wood chip"" flavor that reminds me of the pet store.  I hold out hope that I will find something good, and on a rare occasion I do (the English muffins are fantastic, even if they don't look like the English muffins I'm used to), but mostly I get disappointed.  And when you're paying $7 for a box of cereal, you can only afford to be disappointed so many times.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to Chex and Gorilla Munch.",0.0

"I think one of the other reviewers summed up my feelings best concerning this product with their intro line to their review, ""Have you ever had...dry water?""

My Husband stated he preferred tap water, after I fixed him a glass.  My 9 year old son made a face as he tried to drink it, stated he did not want to finish it, and proceeded to pour the rest down the sink.  My 11 year old tried it, stated he liked milk more than any other kind of beverage, and also said he did not want more.<br /><br />Again, for the health benefits the company advertises related to this water, perhaps that is why some people have given this water rave reviews.  It is simply not for me or for my family. I like tap water, and because tap water has fluoride in it, I feel tap water is better for bones and teeth.

"As a young child I enjoyed eating Cracker Jacks but when I became a man my tastes elevated and I graduated to heavily buttered and salted home-popped popcorn. Now I discovered a popcorn snack that definitely is for mature taste buds that appreciate the finer things in life.<br /><br />SnackWell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn by Nabisco is certainly not as greasy or as salty and has far fewer leftover kernels than my home-popped popcorn. But it has many more benefits than that, like a rich, deep chocolate taste that lingers until the next bite is taken and a subtle but distinct caramel taste. My home-popped snack I eat by the handfuls but SnackWell's popcorn I eat one at a time to fully enjoy this taste treat.<br /><br />This treat was first made in 1992 but it took me nine years to discover it; maybe because they upped the calories from 100 to 130. How can you enjoy a 100-calorie snack? What's with that! And others must have agreed with me because sales for the 100-calorie version sunk from $490 million in 1995 to $32 million in 2010. The 130-calorie version has been introduced on the market with the advertising slogan, ""Be Bad, Snack Well."" Sounds good to me.<br /><br />SnackWell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn comes in a box of five 1.06 ounce individual bags. You might beconcerned about theamounts of sugar, salt and fat, but you can't worry a whole lot about calories when engaged in snacking.<br /><br />Join the chorus, ""Be Bad, Snack Well.""",1.0

"I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them.

"I was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & I'm always eying up new flavors to try out. This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.<br /><br />The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.<br /><br />The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things ""watermelon"" or ""strawberry"" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.<br /><br />One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention ""organic"" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have ""made with organic ingredients"" on it, just ""made with organic sugar"". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this. This has to be the first licorice product that has remained unfinished in my house ever.",0.0

Can't chew for more than a few minutes or so.<br /><br />Warheads<br />Great sour kick on the outside, then only sweet hard candy after that. Good flavor.<br /><br />Toxic Waste<br />Almost exactly the same as Warheads, except these have sour liquid in the middle. Good flavor.

It is a hard candy.<br /><br />Matlow's<br />Also not really sour at all. Pretty good flavor. Hard candy.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I guess their attempt was to give a good mix of sour candy, from very sour to not very sour. That's great, but as a sour candy lover, I would have rather had all very sour candy. I mean, this is a ""Super Sour"" sampler, not a ""Sweet and Sour"" sampler.

"Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why:<br /><br />Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following:<br /><br />  -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces<br />  -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller<br />  -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled<br />  -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal<br />  -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening<br />  agent.<br /><br />This product fits into the first catagory.  Their claim of ""guaranteed uniformity"" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic.<br /><br />All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth.  Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove.<br />Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. ""chi"").<br /><br />I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either.<br /><br />Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the ""Rolls Royce"" of oats, there is a brand called ""Really Raw Oats"". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat).  How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless.<br /><br />The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks.<br /><br />p.s.  the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS!

"Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth.",0.0
"I like these bags and I haven't had any of the quality problems mentioned by some of the other reviewers.  However, there are few things that make this particular packaging of BioBags unappealing to me.<br /><br />First, I seem to have a lot of ""leftovers"" after I've used all the bags.  Each set of 50 comes in it's own cardboard box... a little odd for a product that wants to be environmentally friendly.  However, there's now an bulk option with no individual boxes - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00873RFZU"">BioBag Regular Dog Bags 50 count (Pack of 4) NO BOX</a>.<br /><br />The other leftover is the strip of material that holds each set of 50 bags together.  I assume rolls wouldn't have leftover like this.  I'll find out since rolls are now available - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CGJGK4"">BioBag Dog Waste Bags On Roll, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 5)</a>.  I'll give them a try.  The only trouble is that I haven't yet found a bulk version of rolls.<br /><br />My other issue (other than leftovers) is that these tear-a-bag tablets tend to be more bulky than rolls.  I always found rolls fit  neatly in small spaces like pockets, making it less likely that I'd forget to take a bag when I leave the house.  For example, I always kept a roll of my previous bags in a coat pocket.  I could leave the house many times without thinking about grabbing a bag.  There was almost always some there.  On the other hand, I found these tear-a-bag tablets too bulky for my dog-walking coat and that I'd just tear one off before i left the house.  The problem is how often I'd forget to tear one off (my problem, not the manufacturer's :)<br /><br />--",1.0

The most important thing about dried apricots is that they are not TOO dry.  Very important to refrigerate them after opening, best to fridge them even before, and you have to eat them within a reasonable time frame - they do not keep forever.  It really is potluck when you buy apricots whether you get a really superb batch or not, regardless of brand.  A lot of variables can affect their quality, it is similar to buying produce of any kind at the supermarket.  Sometimes you get a truly splendid banana, sometimes you don't.

"I remember buying Ragu a few years ago and never buying it again, but I could not remember why. Just look at the container, its tomato sauce, what could go wrong. Everything about it is wrong for me now that I tried it once more and I am writing a review to remind me later. This contains sugar and sugar is same as poison for me, the taste just makes me mad. The container label says there is only 10g of sugar per 1/2 cup/128g serving, but when I eat it it feels like 50g. There is no tangy tomato flavor, it feels like I am eating juice or jam or something too sweet, not pasta sauce like. I compared it with a can of ""Del Monte Chunky garlic and herb"" sauce and Del Monte is so much better. It contains 9g High Fructose Syrup in place of Sugar but I felt it was much more satisfying, tastier, less sweet and more tangy than Ragu and its cheaper too. Did i miss to say Del Monte is Chunky while Ragu is not!, even when labelled Chunky. If you want to buy Del Monte sauce online with fast shipping try Amazon's grocery site ""soap"" dot com. Ragu is America's worst tasting sauce not like advertised at all, more like America's favorite Tomato flavored jam/syrup.<br /><br />Also double checked ingredient list on the bottle and it says sugar while amazon says corn syrup.

"I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their ""blueberry pieces"" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks",1.0

"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.",0.0

"I got a sample of this in the mail, along with the Caramel Memento Coffee.<br /><br />I coudln't taste much of a coffee flavor here.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a hot cocoa beverage, without the sugar.  What I really like about the two Memento flavors I tried is that they don't use too much sugar, unlike most of these types of coffee drinks.  They kept the sweetness turned way down.  Unfortunately for this particular Mocha flavor, I didn't taste much of any flavor.  Was it coffee?  Not that I could tell. Was it chocolate? Mocha?  I would have been hard pressed to say exactly what flavor it was had I not already known it was supposed to be Mocha.<br /><br />However, it was pretty good anyway.  It was very creamy tasting.  This one won't compete with any Starbucks offerings, but it's OK, because there is a hint of something along with the cream, I'm just not sure what.<br /><br />The other flavor I tried, the Caramel one, was delicious and I will purchase that.

"I was SOOOO glad to find these on Amazon - and even happier to see that they offered auto delivery.  I don't care for Mediterranean or Turkish apricots as much, and California apricots have become increasingly hard to find.  My local grocery store (a MAJOR chain) recently stopped carrying them, so I immediately started searching online to see where they might be available.  Of course, Amazon was the first place I looked.  I love to cook these (just boil in some water for 15-20 minutes) and maybe add some sugar or artificial sweetener and eat them - especially when a lot of fresh fruits aren't in season.  I often eat them in place of jelly on toast.  But really - if you are searching for apricots to use to make a pie or smaller fried pies, these apricots can't be beat.  They are tart, have a great flavor, and cook up much better than other types of apricots, which usually remain whole, chunky or tough, even after cooking.

I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy.

"Another fine addition to the currently popular trend of so-called ""natural"" alternatives to traditional soda and other soft drinks, Izze ""Sparkling Clementine"" represents the designer soft drink genre at its best.<br /><br />At 80 calories per an 8.oz can, this juice beverage does contain less calories than real juice and normal soda, but can hardly be considered diet food.

Mine does not look  like the picture.  It is definitely a lot more sparse and less ""natural"" looking.  I'm hoping that some pruning will fix that over time.

12 pound miniature poodle enjoys his daily treat.  Others have noticed adverse reactions in their dog; I have not.  I also agree with the 40-79 calories because my guy would certainly be overweight if these treats were 300 calories each!  And he's not overweight at all.  I used the small ones when my guy was a puppy and now he's using the small/medium.  I certainly like these better than the rawhide chews because I would invariably walk barefoot on a moist rawhide piece!  I highly recommend these.,2.0

"I was enchanted by the 'tea essence', but I was not at all pleased.  It did not cover the odor and my apartment reeked while using this.  Not to mention, the green tea litter was tracked all over.  Guess my cat is big on tossing it up...His stools would actually stick to the bottom of the pan with this stuff.  Anyway, more importantly is the high dust content in the litter.  My cat developed upper respiratory issues from it and would sneeze and wheeze.  I didn't like pouring it out of the bag either because it would emit a cloud of dust into the air.<br /><br />Also, the scooper I have has pretty large filters, but not big enough for the large litter balls...so I felt like I was wasting a lot of litter with each cleaning.  Needless to say, we went through this pretty fast.  It just wasn't working out.  I have since switched cat litters and am a happy camper, and so is my cat who is having less and less respiratory issues each day.",0.0

I have tried only the ""chocolate"", and I use quotation marks because it tastes like no chocolate I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm a girl who knows her way around chocolate.  It was absolutely the most disgusting protein drink I have ever tasted.  If you put bark mulch, lawn clippings and a little bit of manure in a blender with milk and drank it - that might be a close comparison to the taste of this stuff, in my humble opinion.  I can't even believe I spent money on these, or that anyone else does.  Maybe if you're one of those people who drinks wheatgrass or eats carob like it's really chocolate, or one of those other ""healthy"" and a way too earthy concoctions, you'll like it.

"I just received my order of this and the regular PB2 today.  I've lost 53 pounds on my current weight loss and exercise program, but have been wandering off down the road to fat land again, with peanut butter and chocolate chips.  I had this for dinner tonight on a multigrain bread, with a banana sliced in.  Can't even imagine the calories I saved and I have no desire to dig into the regular peanut butter jar.<br /><br />The taste isn't quite like real peanut butter, more like roasted peanuts to me, with just a hint of chocolate flavor.  Doesn't matter whether it has the exact taste or not as long as the fat is gone and the taste is good.  This passes the test with flying colors.<br /><br />The texture is not quite like the creamy fat of real peanut butter either, but I'm not bothered by it at all.<br /><br />I will buy this again and hope that my review helps others to at least give it a try.  It might just be my new BFF for the next 40 lbs.<br /><br />Glad I heard about this and decided to take it for a test drive.",2.0
"I have 4 felines of my own and feed the one who sleeps in my backyard who has been stopping by to eat supper on an  almost daily basis for 3 years.<br />I am never surprised at the things my finiky, spoiled kittys will turn their collective noses up about. I have learned through testing and error what they will generally eat, but they never cease to amaze me: will not touch crab, shrimp, calf liver or lamb. Usually they are pretty good about all things seafood though. I am aware that the older female is not fond of food in the form of Pate. However, I have two kittens who will generally eat whatever is put before them (the no crab, shrimp, liver or lamb rules were in place when they arrived.) The older male is better about taking on new things than the older female. He WILL eat pate.<br />This particular item Friskies Cat Foof Classic Pate, 4 flavor Seafood Variety Pack was purchased primarily for the outside kitty who is not technically mine. I buy Friskies food for him all the time. It is so convenient to have these Packs set up on Subscribe and Save. They are delivered to my front door and I do not have to lug them home from the local grocers. That gives almost everything that arrives from Amazon on a routine basis a 3 star rating from me to start with. Usually Subscribe and Save Items work UP to a 4 star or 5 star rating from there. I have no shame, but say with gratitude that those items have a favorable positive predjudice from me going for them from the beginning! This Pack was no exception. I thought my older female might refuse it, but expected to hysteria from the others, outside Kitty inclded.<br />All four inside cats are now getting a half of a 3 oz can at their back feeding station at supper time. I used to give them all a whole can, but jealousy of the kittens is still present, so each gets a half and then I go to fix dinner for my outside, feral guy who is known simply as ""Yellow Kitty.""<br />Now, I am not dense, I realize that the four of mine were accostomed to an entire 3 oz can each for supper at one point. Then the green eyed monster of Jealousy appeared on the scene and brought along with her Screeches and Skirmishes over what bowl belonged to whom (Each had his own station which was 10 feet away from the next fur person. Squabbles ensued anyway.) So the Front Feeding Station now has two bowls which hold a half can each and in the next room is the Kitten Station with two bowls which hold a half can. Everyone circulates around and disagreements have almost disappeared. I admit to the use on the elder cats of a calming collar: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLYWLQ"">Calming Cat Collar 1 Count</a> and to the use of Feliway throughout the house.:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608SVD4"">Feliway Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial</a>.<br />Having become an artist at cat rigamarole, I usually suceed in finding foods that the cats will eat. Friskies is a dietary staple. I receive The The Meaty Bits and the Seafood variety pack plus the Pouches of Gravy Sensations on a regular rotating basis. EVERYBODY will eat those. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376301U"">Friskies Prime Filets Seafood Selections Variety Pack, Seafood, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJG2H2"">Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Variety Pack, 24-Count</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K"">Friskies Gravy Sensations Pouch Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>.<br />The Pates being reviewed came up on Amazon's Recommendations For Me a few days ago. I was thrilled. This was a 32 pack instead of the 24 Packs that I usually get. So I ordered it right away. I was just about out of large canned food and none was due until mid January.<br />During my feeding production tonight, I gave part of one can of food, thereby using 3 of the varieties, placed at various feeding stations. I paid no attention to who ate what but headed out to feed the outside boy, Yellow Kitty. Salmon flavor had not gone to an indoor cat, so I gave it to him, along with a can of Mariner's Stew. Yellow Kitty eats a lot in the winter when it is cold and hunting is difficult. He is only fed in the evening, so will eat a lot at his first sitting, then nibble on and off until his next feeding.<br />Today was a BUSY DAY. It is 21ntin days until Christmas and I still have many things to wrap. Little last minute sales precipitate unplanned purchases, and that means more wrapping, and, what is for Christmas Dinner. Better be on that too!<br />So, I paid little attention to who ate what and went busily on my way. It must have also been ""noisily"" on my was as no one mentioned a thing.<br />As I was preparing for bed, I started turning off lights. The back door light was on. Yellow Kitty is fed by the back door. His wet food bowls were almost full though the dry food was almost depleted, which was unusual. Usually he eats the wet food first. Hmmmmmm.....<br />Front feeding station: Friskies Meaty bits which were a leftover, had disappeared. Otherwise, it appeared that one or two bites had been taken and then the rest was left. Kitten Room: Bowls were full, just as they were in the back feeding station. Oh well, I went to bed.<br />The next morning, bowls were still full. Breakfast of a different variety was served and gobbled down by all.<br /><br />This scenario took place several times over the next 10 days. Yellow Kitty, who lives outside, finally began to give in and eat about half his normal portion. My inside kids continued to nibble at the pate. They then ate some dry food and waited a bit, THEN BEGAN TO COMPLAIN LOUDLY FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT! I finally caved and gave them a different menu.<br /><br />This product recieves 2 Stars which represents ""I don't like it."" I really would not personally have feeling about the Pate and would let the cats vote. HOWEVER 1. I have had to clean up several uneaten meals which means picking up and doing something with 4-6 bowls of disgusting looking brown stuff which purports that it is Cat Food; however, my guys will not eat it. 2. I have to delete my Subscribe and Save order. It ism't much of a pain to do so, but I like to think that if I put an item on S&S, I will give Amazon their money's worth and reorder the item several times. 3. Also, I now have about 3/4 of the pack in the cupboard and that must be taken out and donated to someone. It adds up to more work than I had in mind.<br /><br />I guess that is the 2 star bottom line: my cats will not eat it and it causes a disposal dilemma. Gabriella, Trinity, Mischief, Mercy, Yellow Kitty and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT because none of my 5 Fur People will eat it.",0.0
I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue.

"We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.

"In my never ending quest to find low calorie nutritious food, I bought some of this powdered peanut butter. I love peanut butter and eat a little bit most days of the week.  I am somewhat conditioned to the natural flavor and richness of the real thing.<br />I'd read that this PB2 is not the same as regular peanut butter, but many reviewers say it's a good substitute.  Therefore I expected it to be different, but not distasteful. I'm used to eating healthy fare and realize there has to be a trade off.  However, I was quite disappointed in this product. It feels chalky and tastes like stale fake peanuts. For someone on a restricted diet who is desperate to eat some type of peanut butter, this may work.

"I was so excited to find these peanut butter cups at our local market. I love peanut butter cups...they are my all time favorite chocolate choice. I had to stop getting the ""Reeces"" kind because of the corn syrup in the ingredients. I was also glad to see that these were organic. How much better can you get? Well...I thought they were the biggest disappoint I have ever had in a candy. The texture was fine, but the taste was almost inedible. I actually didn't even finish one of the cups and then threw the rest away. I didn't think it was even possible to make a bad peanut butter cup. I give it to Justin's brand to be making an organic, corn free alternative to our favorites, but I won't be buying these anymore. I actually found an alternative at Trader Joe's that doesn't have corn in them and while they are not organic they taste GREAT and I will be sticking with those for now.",0.0

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints.

Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor.

"I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste ""off"" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(",0.0

Ordered this coffee only because the flavor enticed me - Chocolate Caramel Brownie.  I've had other chocolate flavored coffee before but this one I found<br />to be exceptionally good.

"The package is 12 packages of 6 Pouches.  In each pouch, there is two bars.  But who cares how many bars in each pouch?  The weigh of each pocuch matters, but not how manufacturer package the each pouch.  If manufaturer decides to package each pouch with 8 small tiny bars, it does not make the package more valuable.  In short, I thought it is 12 x 12 snacks for me, which is good price.  It ended up 12 X 6 snacks for me, which is not so good price.  I can buy the same product at local stores cheaper and at smaller quarntity.  Why shall I order online and buy large quantity if there is no saving?  Disappointed.",0.0

"Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND"">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, ""If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on.""<br /><br />There are many sellers offering sriracha on Amazon.com. I recommend you compare the shipping charges of each. You can save by buying in quantity (and sharing with friends and relatives). Many supermarket chains are now carrying sriracha for $5 or less per bottle, again depending on the size.<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed ""Thai ketchup."" Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars",2.0

"I only feel ho-hum about these cookies. They seem like they are really more of a vessel for chocolate rather than a cookie. It seems that there is barely any of the chewy cookie and what is there doesn't have enough cookie flavor to it. The cookies are overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate in them.<br /><br />They also seemed a bit overpriced for a small package. Even though the outside package is about the same size as the regular chewy cookies, there are a few ounces less of actual product and a bit more packaging. I also found them in my local store for almost half the price listed here on Amazon.<br /><br />I found the cookies to be okay and easily finished off the package in a few days. My husband didn't care for them, so I have no one else to blame for eating all of the cookies. He prefers the regular Chips Ahoy cookies (non-chewy) and I found that I do, too.

I don't see myself picking these up at my local store at any time even with a lower price.<br /><br />These cookies just didn't work for me.",0.0

"I have been eating and baking brownies for forty years and the Dassant Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix makes the best brownies on earth. These brownies are for chocolate lovers that like a very intense dark chocolate flavor. I don't know their secret but this mix produces brownies bursting with flavor in every bite. There is no need for a mixer and the mix will be very dense and thick so you will need to spoon it into your baking pan and level it out with a strong spatula. I love the combination of nuts and chocolate so I usually add walnuts to the mix and they bake up beautifully. You will want to experiment with the cooking time depending on how fudgy or cake-like you want your brownies. I recommend testing the center several times with a toothpick to ensure adequate baking. My house is at 5,000 feet of altitude so I find it takes longer to bake properly than is indicated on the box.

"My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as ""inspected for human consumption"". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.",1.0

Even after putting them in a sandwich baggy for training during our walking session, the smell clung to my coat. Basically, anything these things touch, they'll share their smell with.<br /><br />Stench aside, these are fabulous treats. My dog responds more readily to them during our training sessions than any others I've tried so far (guess what disgusts me smells like heaven to him). They're also already the perfect size, which is very convenient.<br /><br />I'll definitely try out some different flavors next time.",1.0

"I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6/25/12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats.",0.0
"When I got home from work, my cookies were waiting for me at the front door; baking in the sun on a 113°F day, probably for 2 or 3 hours.  Inside each pack, the two cookies melded together and would not separate.  They are about 2 inches in diameter and break/crumble easily.  They can actually be quite messy to eat, so beware giving them to a child or while wearing white.  ;)  They are not soft, moist or chewy at all, but not brittle either.  The center of the cookie has a small pool of dark chocolate that kind of oozes out when you partially bit into it.  The expiration date on the cookie wrappers were about 2 weeks from the date of arrival, so I store them in the freezer to keep longer.<br /><br />My 11-year old son, my husband and I tried them while they were still hot.  My husband (a junk-food-junkie) only ate half a cookie and threw away the rest.  He prefers soft cookies, so these were just too hard and bland to him.  He'd give these 2 stars.  My son, on the other hand, loves them and would give them 5 stars!  In fact, he chooses these over fudge popsicles and other favored deserts, which kind of surprises me.  He prefers the typical American child's diet, like pizza and hamburgers, so I was expecting him to throw his away too.<br /><br />I think the cookies have a rich DARK-chocolate taste (fringing on being too rich) and almost tastes like there is a hint of alcohol in them (like rum or something like that).  I don't know why I taste that, but I do every time.  I'm not a milk drinker; however, I usually need to drink it with these cookies.  It's easy only eating 1 package because they are too rich to want more.  I think these are good cookies, not great, and would personally give them 4 stars.<br /><br />I suspect that the unusual circumstances of waiting in 113°F weather tampered with the cookies texture and perhaps taste too.  I have never tried this brand of cookies before, so keep in mind I don't have any reference to compare these to.",1.0

"When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is ""THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says ""Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?"" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on ""Subscibe and Save"" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off ""Subscribe and Save"" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something ""different"" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY"">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year!

I have switched to other instant coffees, but all of them taste like dishwater. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003G2JISO"">Nescafe Classic Instant Coffee, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> has the best smoothest taste.",2.0
"A word of caution to anyone considering buying these: Read the ingredients first! I made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer (Oberto brand) ones our local Costco used to sell, so I ordered up 10 bags to get the volume discount offered at the time. I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.",0.0

"I am not a very big coffee drinker, but do like to have a cup every once in awhile. I definitely don't like a bold, strong coffee. I like a very faint coffee taste. So I figured I would try this brand and flavor to start. I really like it. It has such a nice, rich, warm vanilla taste to it. Depending upon how much milk and sweetener you put in it, it could almost be like a vanilla latte. I am glad I tried it out, it has a great taste.",2.0
"I think the problem with this toy is that the rope fills up too much of the bottle neck which makes getting a treat out of the container nearly impossible.

"I did not like this at all, worse than the gas station cappiccino, which I do like. The grove square french vanilla is just nasty really and it leaves a bad after taste. oh and you have to run a hot water cycle after using it to clean the machine, nothing lefted in the k-cup either, well just a little bit of water to leak from the k-cup when throwing away. I will not buy this again at any price.<br />The only reason for the one star rating was because the shipping and packaging of the products was nicely done, free super saving shipping is great. I just wish the contents of said packaging had been on par. anyone know of a good cappuccino for the keurig?",0.0

"My husband drinks energy drinks nearly every day, so I'm always looking for a good deal.  These were on the Friday Sale, so I ordered a two-pack.  It's an ok deal, but if you watch sales, you can find them about the same price elsewhere.<br /><br />I do like having them shipped to me.  That's nice.  Packaging could be a little better, but that feedback was left in the appropriate place.  I just wish that it hadn't taken twice as long as any other product I have ordered with the Super Saver shipping.  I know that it came well within the aloted time, and I know that they said it takes a few extra days, but I'm spoiled with Amazon's amazingly fast shipping.  We had run out at home, and I was hoping to not have to make the shopping trip.<br /><br />In the end, my husband was quite happy to come home to a fresh 24 pack waiting for him on the doorstep.",1.0

"This package arrived with three bags of coffee inside of a plastic outer bag. The outer bag was full of coffee grinds. Upon inspection, I found a hole (about 1/2"" long) in the bottom of one of the coffee bags. I cannot believe that someone didn't noticed the grinds all over the bag before it shipped. However, perhaps they did but did not care as the customer cannot return the item. I've used the other two bags but had to throw out the open one for safety reasons. DO NOT BUY!!!",0.0

"Sometimes, I am a sucker for the new stuff, and this is one fine example.  In my quest to drink more water, I sought out flavorings.  My perception of this product is quite different from the reality I experienced after buying it.<br /><br />Being a marketing professional myself, I think I have this gimmick figured out perfectly.  If only I had not fallen for it, I would feel a lot better.  So, here is how the gimmick goes:<br /><br />1. Rather than selling consumers perfectly portioned pouches of flavored powder, such as those sold under the Crystal Light brand and other brands, sell it to them in liquid form and claim that is has 24 servings inside.  This makes it seem like a good value per serving, but a ""serving"" is a meaningless measure, as consumers will squirt and squirt and squirt some more to get enough flavoring.  The bottle doesn't say how many squirts is 1 serving.  Rest assured, consumers will use far more than 1 serving at a time, and they will never know how many servings they really get from the bottle.<br /><br />2. Since a squirt bottle can come in only one flavor, consumers will have to buy lots of bottles, rather than just a nice variety pack of the single-serve Crystal Light or similar packets.  This ""pantry loading"", as they call it, not only leads to higher sales up front, but it also locks in the consumer, who feels wedded to his investment.<br /><br />3. Tell the consumer on the package that the contents should be used within 30 days of opening the bottle.  This will make consumers either (a) throw it out for fear that it has gone bad or (b) use it up faster to prevent if from going bad.  Either way, this means more sales from new sales.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product is made by the same company that sells Crystal Light--Kraft Foods.  This tells me they are not satisfied with certain aspects of Crystal Light, such as the fact that others make generic versions and sell them more cheaply.  Hence, they have created a product that competes with Crystal Light, in hopes that at least some of them will switch, leading to enhanced profitability and less competition from those pesky alternatives in powder form.",0.0
"Once years ago Lipton Noodle Soups was great. On late night shift, pull out the thermos and a packet of Lipton noodle soup, and your mouth watered just waiting for it to be ready. Now, most Lipton noodle soups you purchase today, has been sitting on a shelf too long. It a rarity to find one fairly fresh, and yet still there the hint of the feeling the noodles are made of chalk. It obvious they tried to safe a penny too many in regards to their noodle. Stay away from this product.",0.0
"I love the beans, but this design of the cup is not good-- the cups are not sealed all the way and after the first few cups, the coffee starts to get stale unless you vacuum seal the k-cups.

My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years.  We have always used the medium roast.  On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old.  Very nasty.  The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I don't know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods.  These are so bad we can't even drink them.  I'm going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig.  VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old.,0.0

I've used it a number of time and it seemed to be holding up fine. I haven't used it for very heavy things yet though. I would buy them again, but would be a little cautious about the quality.

"After saying goodbye to chips about a year ago I've missed them.  Chips taste amazing am I right?  The bad thing is they are extremely unhealthy with tons of bad fats in them, including they have no nutrition.  It's just pure unhealthy.  As someone who is trying to get a lot of protein in their diet I had seen these.  Since I've missed chips so much I thought I'd try them.  The hard truth is while these are healthy the taste is really just not that good.  They're good enough to like them but not good enough to love them either.  I may buy more of this in the future but I may look for other products instead.  Just because these are great for protein, 12g protein, low fat, low calories, and decent taste Ill give these 4/5 stars",1.0
"****<br />This is a fine chai spice tea from Stash, made from blended black teas, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and natural flavors of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Many chai spice teas (which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener) nauseate me, but this one did not---I loved it! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea. I brewed the tea as I always do, leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3-5 minutes recommended brewing time, and the tea never turned bitter, just got stronger and tastier!<br />****",1.0

I am healthy, not a diabetic or overweight. But in my opinion the sugar is the cause of many problems that take some years to develop. So I sought cookies that are sweetened with stevia. Fat I don't mind, vegan or not I don't mind. I don't want sugar, and I don't want artificial ingredients,  and these cookies deliver. Two thumbs up.

"Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner has a lot of pluses.  I've got dry and frizzy hair and usually use $20 per bottle stuff to try to combat it.

"...but if you've had the good stuff, this is a little bit disappointing. The wax is very waxy tasting, instead of being really infused with the honey and instead of being soft and pliable, it was brittle, which is something I've never experienced with honeycomb. Additionally, the comb part wasn't full and complete--the edges were broken and there were broken 'holes' in the interior part of it, instead of being a weavy-comb like it should have been.<br /><br />On the plus side, there was a good amount of honey in the box and the plastic packaging that it's in is hard plastic with an easy enough pop top to it. When the product was delivered, it had melted and slid all to one side, and had leaked out of the packaging. I'm not rating this product by the packaging or the shipping though (I gave shipping feedback elsewhere). This is just about the honeycomb product inside.<br /><br />It's not bad and if you've never had the good stuff, for a fair price, this one is fine enough maybe to get for the kids to try it. If you're wanting it for cooking, for a gourmet or specialty display or to use for something that requires a solid, full and soft, pliable wax, this isn't your product.<br /><br />But for just sucking on some honeycomb and chewing some wax, for kids who don't know the difference, or even for breaking off a piece to drop into a tea or a hot drink, this is good enough, at a fair enough price.",1.0
"I love this syrup; it is clean-tasting and minty in a natural way. The Monin flavored syrups are much like Torani syrups, only better. (Except they are harder to find locally.)

"I got these as gifts and absolutely love them. Yes, you can use ice cube trays to freeze baby food & other things but these are so much more convenient for me since they're = a jar of baby food, plus the reason I really love them is that I have continued to use them all the time after we were done with purees. I have 19 month old twins & made all their purees & continue to make a lot of their food and freeze things ahead for easy defrost & prep at the end of my work day when we get home & they're starving.  I'm not sure why another person was trying to scoop the portions out with a spoon (?) but all you have to do is run hot water over the back side for about 30 sec and everything pops out no problem. I have the same issue w/ ice cube trays so I don't really understand the issue others have reported.<br />So, in addition to purees, I have frozen things like the following in these to = 1/2 or full portion sizes for my kids (depending on how old they were, obviously I need to defrost more of them as they get older): risottos, ground beef/turkey, small meatballs & sauce, mac & cheese, small portions of elbow macaroni (when they were younger & couldn't eat as much), and anything else really that can be smooshed into the container. These are things that would not work in an ice cube tray & freezing in a million containers or one big one is not practical, at least for me.<br /><br />It's too bad they're not a little more affordable but I do think they're great.",2.0
"I've tried numerous canned -grain free- foods for my cat Roxie. She just doesn't care for them. I opened the can of Paw Lickin' Chicken food from Weruva and she started eating right away and never stopped till it was all gone! I was shocked! She's always had a lot of allergies and has always been picky when it comes to canned foods...so i was a happy camper when i saw how she took to Weruva's food. I contacted Weruva via email to tell them how impressed i was and to inquire where i could just purchase some single cans instead of a complete case of each of their flavors to try on Roxie. They responded immediately (actually the President of the company and co-owner responded) - WOW!  They were very helpful and gave me a lot of insight about cats and allergies and such. I did order about 8 different cans/flavors from one of the websites they mentioned and am anxious to see how Roxie does with the other flavors. Again, i am very pleased with their food and the company itself!  Will definitly order again!",2.0

"I nevr tasted 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added ""flavored coffee creamer"" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod.",2.0

"I can't get enough of this tea! The experience starts when you tear open the envelope and inhale the gorgeous aromas of cinnamon, cloves and ginger. Continue enjoying the calming scent as your tea steeps in the hot water and meditat on the little pearl of wisdom written on each tag. Finally, in 3 to 5 minutes when you drink your tea, you'll start to realize while no other green chai tea will ever measure up again. This is the best - truly, therapy in a cup. But please note: if you're not used to chai tea, it may take a few cups to get used to - I think it's a little stronger than other chai. The traditional way to drink this is with sweetener and a little milk, although I prefer mine with just hot water. Often I will throw a thimble-sized amount of peeled and chopped fresh ginger root into my mug and leave it in there as an extra health and flavor boost while I drink my tea. Heavenly!",2.0
"These spoon tips are brilliant for at home or on the go.  The only issue I have is that it would be a little better if the hole that feeds the food onto the spoon was a bit lower in the ""bowl"" of the spoon.  You have to squeeze the pouch, then tip the spoon down to let it roll to the front.  Either that, or you have to squeeze some much out that it's kind of too much for their mouth, at least for a small child (mine is 9 months).  They come in a little clip-on little case which is now always on my diaper bag.  Overall, one of my favorite new baby gear items. Thanks Boon!!!",1.0
"Had come across a number of comments mentioning that the taste isn't the same as it used to be.<br /><br />I don't know how it tasted previously, but the contents of this packaging are perfectly fine in taste. I found that cooling the contents a bit tasted much better than consuming them at room temperature or chilling them.<br /><br />Also, the contents contain more sodium than water but, then again, you derive maximum benefit from coconut water if you use it as protection against dehydration or for replenishment, and not as a substitute for regular water. Also, drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade seemed to make me feel more bloated - so far, I have experienced nothing of that sort with Zico. Admittedly, carrying a Powerade bottle to the gym looks much more normal than carrying a Zico coconut water bottle :-)<br /><br />For what it's worth, my mom-in-law suffers from hyperacidity and has found the Natural variant of ZICO to be a blessing.<br /><br />I didn't give this 5 stars because I haven't been consuming it for long to know what side effects there might be, and nothing beats real coconut water, right out of a tropical coconut.",1.0

"Alton Brown or not, I like this salt server. I have been looking for a small container for my chili oil, complete with a spoon that fits in it, so I won't have to pull out extra spoons especially when I have already used that same spoon for mixing stuff and then realizing I want to add more chili oil. It was a long search, and some of the containers/jars are just too big when all I needed was something that could handle approximately a cup of whatever. This was what I was looking for.<br /><br />The stainless steel casing was very elegant, and goes well with our predominantly white kitchen. It comes with a tiny spoon (perfect for pinches) that fits in the container without having a ""slot"" on the lid for which serving spoons usually protrude out of, which makes it ideal for my sauce, since I'd like to keep pests and most air out.<br /><br />Of course this thing is not for pouring, at least as a whole, as the glass bowl is fitted loosely around the frame. If you need to pour its contents, remove the bowl from the steel frame first. And the lid doesn't ""seal"" the container, merely covering it up and protecting its contents with the silicone gasket.<br /><br />Overall, it's not only for salt, it's also for sauces too!

Now I am not a child but I have been accused of acting like a child quite often in life so I feel that I am qualified to review this product.<br /><br />One thing to note these do taste great I mean I've always had a thing for baby food and these are healthy organic and delicious. The one thing I was most concerned with when I received my order was that the best if used by date was more than a month past the date my order arrived. Now I'm not somebody who freaks out about expiration/best if used by dates because let's be real most things are fine long after that date has elapsed. But apparent of a child that 6+ months old is going to be very concerned with that. So not sure why would get one so past-due but they were fine to me.<br /><br />Now since that I am an adult I did an adult thing and mixed mine was a little bit of vodka (I do not recommend doing this for children remember drink responsibly) but it made a delicious vodkas smoothly that I enjoyed and will probably enjoy again in the future.<br /><br /> anyway I hope you found this useful be awesome!,1.0
"I was used to the bleached white parchment paper and wasn't sure how the unbleached stuff would perform. Turns out that it's a little heavier than the commercially available stuff, and also coated with silicon. I'm not sure it needs that, since I've never had any kind of sticking problem with plain parchment paper.<br />That said, you can use it several times, as long as it doesn't get oily from whatever you're baking. So it's economical -- I bake at least twice a week and it looks like the three pack will last a year or so.<br /><br />You can tear the paper using the box if you're careful to hold your thumb near the edge so you get a good rip started. It's worth two seconds of extra time to save that blade from going through the waste cycle.<br /><br />So far, I like it, recommend it and will purchase it again.",1.0

"I am a tea drinker and love to try new varieties of tea. The Blackberry Vanilla from Lipton is a lovely, naturally decaf tea. I love the Pyramid tea bags and do think they make a difference when brewing herbal teas. Herbal tea (which actually contains no tea at all) generally has larger pieces of the ingredients than traditional black or green teas. The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.<br /><br />The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions. The blackberry and vanilla flavors are undercurrents and I wish these flavors had been a bit more prominent.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the Lipton Blackberry Vanilla tea and I'm sure it will be a variety that I will purchase in the future.",1.0

"I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.

"This is the third set of this brand pantry moth trap I've purchased.  It's virtually impossible to permanently rid your pantry of moth eggs once you have a moth.  They come in cycles for us.  The traps attract and catch all the adults.  They hatch in cycles, months apart.  The traps will sit empty for a long time, then suddenly I'll find 8 moths in one.  We keep as much food as possible in tightly sealed containers, but always have open cereals and cracker boxes on hand.  Since we started using the traps I've never found moths in the food or flying around.  They just show up in the traps.  You are supposed to replace the traps every three months, but ours have been working for longer periods - probably 5 months.",2.0
"I should have paid attention to the negative reviews, I guess. I was looking for an inexpensive tea chest. Nothing fancy, just a basic box. After waiting from September 24 (when I placed the order) till today, October 4, the tea chest finally arrived. The logo on the outside of the box is facing the wrong direction which is really irritating -- but even better is the fact that the logo INSIDE the chest is also facing the wrong direction (ie: it's upside down). I realize you get what you pay for but for $20 I would have expected that the logos would at least be properly applied. Beyond that, it's at least fairly well made, and the hinges line up and so on. It's just the logos totally destroy the look of the chest and you can't even remove the lid and put it on properly because of the way it's made. Don't waste your money, is my vote. Oh, and incidentally, a bunch of people were saying that the tea IS included -- it was not included with mine. Despite the fact that the tea is NOT included and the logos are improperly applied, this item is ""ineligible for return"" so I am stuck with the upside down logos. Swell. Save your money, unless you're willing to be stuck with it. :/",0.0

"Mother's Cookies have been around forever here on the west coast.  I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).  I am glad Kellogg's bought the company and brought them back.  I recently tried the Vanilla Creme cookie not knowing what to expect.  I was used to the Circus Animals and their delicious chocolate chip cookie over the years since I was a child.  Their Vanilla Creme cookie is just out of this world and makes me glad I have a mouth!  That's how good they are.  It is an exquisite cookie.  No coffee or tea should be served to company without these.  Your friends will wonder what they are and where they come from!<br /><br />In addition to being a great tasting cookie I love the design and texture of the cookie.  I feel really regal when I eat them.  I introduced these to the whole family and I got everyone eating them.  The local supermarket had a sale on them at two dollars a package and I ended up buying seven of them.<br /><br />If you like the taste of vanilla and are looking for a good cookie to try or just plain like cookies, you won't be disappointed with these!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to write a review for Mother's English Tea cookie but apparently Amazon has all the reviews linked to all Mother's cookies products and will only accept one review.<br /><br />I wanted to write that that English Tea cookie by Mother's is just as good as the Vanilla Cremes.  I am not sure but I thought I detected a slight banana flavor but very subtle.  They certainly don't taste like vanilla but they are a really good cookie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s Mother's Cookies used to put out a variety pack and that's how I discovered their delicious chocolate chip cookie.  It has a chocolate chip taste so different than any other chocolate chip cookie I've eaten.<br /><br />I understand Mother's cookies are hard to find for much of the country except on the west coast.  The fact that Amazon sells them is a good thing.  So if you're wondering if you should give them a try, please believe me, they're all high quality cookies and taste great regardless if they become a favorite or not.  I am very fussy when it comes to food but Mother's cookies are so delicious that I am working my way to try every cookie they offer.  Vanilla Creme is by far my favorite.  As a side note, if your cookies should arrive crumbled or broken, it's the responsibility of the buyer to contact Amazon and complain.

"Ok, so I've had some of the other flavors from these PowerBars before.  And I liked them.  But then I tried this lemon flavor and blech.  It just did not work for me.<br /><br />The flavor actually was somewhat reminiscent of a lemon cleaner.  It just didn't taste like natural lemons at all and the gooey center was even worse.  It was sickly sweet to go along with the fake lemon flavor and I just couldn't enjoy them.  I managed to eat them all in one quick succession, but I didn't enjoy it.  I guess one good point was that it was kind of lemon zesty, so if you like that type of lemon flavor this may work for you.  But I like my lemons to be somewhat sour, with just a hint of sweet, kind of like a good lemonade.<br /><br />The ingredients in these chews aren't too bad.  They're designed to give energy, so there's quite a bit of sugar and glucose in them.  The flavoring and colorings are natural and even though I kept commenting on a fake lemon flavor, it is actually real.  So who knows what happened there.  There are 190 calories in this packet of gummies.  Which is a lot. And the sugar content is 35 grams, which is also quite a bit. This is designed to go with a fitness regimen, and not for just snacking on like you would a fruit roll-up.  Granted I haven't been using it for it's intended purpose, but I thought it might give me a little extra energy.  Which at this time I'm on the fence about, because I'm still awake, but I certainly don't feel like skipping around.  So maybe it's just enough energy to keep me going through the day.<br /><br />Not my favorite flavor.  I'd go back to another flavor of these, but certainly not this one.<br /><br />Review by M.

"Culinary Teas Gourmet Teas Pumpkin Spice Tea<br /><br />Price: >$16 (4oz bag shipping added to my total) Purchased through amazon<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: Undetermined, I'd estimate 15-30 since the base is not all black tea<br />Ingredients:<br />Luxury Black tea, Hibiscus, Rosehip, Almond pieces, Cinnamon pieces, Rooibos, Vanilla pieces, Apple pieces + Natural dried Orange, Sunflower + Calendula petals, Triacetin, Natural flavors.<br /><br />-Smell (.5) - The smell is not very strong nor does it remind me of pumpkin  or fall. Scent falls flat<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (.5) - Does not taste like anything other than normal tea.<br />++Iced (1) - again no flavor is present aside from just tea to me<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain Lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea.

"I typically only like to drink Timothy's and Emeril's coffees.  I like coffee strong, without bitter aftertaste.  For a decaf, this is great coffee.

Only downside is that I think it has more caffeine than other weak decaf coffees.  I like it, but it does affect sleep.

"I was happy to get my coffee. Me without coffee is like a baby without her sippy cup! I tore the box open and my heart sank. The individual K-Cups were just thrown around. The bottom of the box had a good amount of coffee grinds. I don't think the post office is responsible for the mishap because the box didn't appear damaged. The only logical explanation is the damage originated where the K-Cups were loaded into the box. Five out of the 50 K-Cups were unusable. If you don't think 10 percent is a big deal, then imagine going on a blind date and your blind date answers the door and you notice he/she is missing 10 percent of his/her teeth!

"My sister tried these out with one of her  dogs.  She says:<br /><br />I gave the stick a try with our small rat terrier mix, Nellie.  At first I couldn't figure out how to open it the bottle.  It looked like you pealed the wrapper off the lid area, but it wasn't coming.  Then I could see the faint perforated line around the base of the cap and you twist to break that, like a salad dressing bottle.  The stick itself is like a deodorant roll-on. Seriously.  The instructions say to shake it up before offering.  This stick was a ""chicken flavor"".  I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.  If you put it up close to you, it is strong, so I just kept it down at dog level.<br /><br />This is a very odd way to give a treat to a dog.

"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box.

"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!""",0.0

"These are tasty and light -- but on the smallish side.  They are for sure meant as a snack, not as a meal replacement.

"I'll admit it, I am a bit of a Starbucks addict. I love my Caramel Macchiatos and a flavored latte is just the perfect coffee drink for pretty much any day. So when I saw this product I decided to try it, hoping to be able to satisfy my craving for a daily vanilla latte also on the days when a trip to midtown would involve a major detour.<br />I wasn't disappointed - a heaping tablespoon of this coffee in my French press, steeped for about 8 minutes, delivered a drink that with just a little milk and sugar was a pretty satisfying substitute for a vanilla latte, that was also a hit with my equally Starbucks addicted brother-in-law at a brunch.<br /><br />I'd recommend it.<br /><br />(Note: I only received one pack, not two.)",1.0
I ordered these because I love the barbeque Inca Corn.  I generally like picante and thought these would be a fun change.

Sometimes these bottled waters, especially those with ulterior motives, can have an almost thick texture, but Essentia goes down with ease.  Now, this water is infused with electrolytes and is formatted to help reduce acid reflux and help with indigestion.  I must admit that this works rather well in that regard.  I've had an issue with indigestion for a while (years) and while I can't say that this has cured me entirely, I have noticed a difference in the way I feel.  I'm glad that some have compared this to Evian, because Evian is one brand of water I cannot stomach (talking of thick water), but Essentia is clean and smooth and serves its purpose beautifully.",2.0

"My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my ""stomach of steel"" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this.

"Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini treats are perfect for training dogs, especially a puppy in my case.  I picked these treats for my new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.  She immediately loved them.  Since puppies have such short attention spans and require so much training, I need to use them frequently!  They are very reasonably priced compared to most products found in pet stores and have all natural healthy ingredients.  The small size of these treats allows you to get great use out of them, while giving them to your dog frequently for good behavior.  You won't need to constantly replenish your supply either.",2.0

"This is a good variety of K-cups for those who like flavored coffee.

"Every Nature's Path product I've had has been great and their Organic Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise cereal is no exception. Featuring about four different shapes and textures into on cereal make for an interesting dining experience, and quite a tasty one at that. With a light vanilla flavor, it's sweeter than I was expecting, this is more for the consumer with a sweet tooth of which I am on occasion, but it isn't so sweet that you'd want to sprint to the nearest dentist after eating. This would be a great cereal for kids as a replacement for the unhealthier cereals marketed for children out there, the only downside is the box screams healthy and not ""Kids, eat me!"" All organic and natural, the ingredient list a dream; I love when I know what everything actually is. Nature's Path is a product of the USA and the box is made from 100% recycled paperboard, which makes this recycler happy.<br /><br />Here's a glance at the more important nutritional facts:<br /><br />Serving size: 2/3 cup (Seems a bit measly but fairly normal in comparison to most other cereals, which are usually 3/4 cup, but it's about the amount I generally have for breakfast anyway.)<br />Calories: 110 with just the cereal, only 10 from fat.<br />Total fat: 1 gram, no evil fats like saturated or trans, but no polyunsaturated or monounsaturated, which are good for you, either.<br />Cholesterol: Zilch<br />Sodium: 130 mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 25 grams<br />Dietary Fiber (included in Total Carbs): 3 grams (Could be better but better than a lot of cereals.)<br />Sugars (included in Total Carbs): 7 grams (Not bad, not bad at all. Ideally, one shouldn't have more than 6 g for breakfast, but what's one gram? ;P)<br />Protein: 2 grams<br />The cereal is also gluten-free and contains 11% (.15 grams) of omega 3 fatty acids per serving.<br />No real added vitamins to speak of.<br /><br />So, would I buy this again? Heck yeah. The blend of flavors, from the vanilla to the added sweetness to the flakes to the Kix-like spheres, it's one of my new faves. Topped with slices of banana, it lifts my mood like the morning sunrise. :D",2.0
"I bought this product because my Splenda in 9.7 oz packages became unavailable.  I was willing to give it a reasonable try but I just don't like the flavor.  It's not exactly bitter, maybe chemical-like is a better description.  It makes my tea taste off and leaves an unpleasant tingle on the tongue.  So, it does look like sugar though it is less sweet, but I don't like the taste.  And, I think, for the price, you aren't getting anywhere near enough product.  A twelve oz. bag of this stuff is about the equivalent of a 2/3rds full sandwich bag.  I was quite disappointed overall.",0.0

"I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. This flavor variety is by far my favorite of all the Annie's Bunny Gummies. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! I recommend trying the berry patch flavor as well!!<br /><br />Another great fruit snack to try if you like this texture is Ocean Spray brand. They are not organic, but they are less than half the price of these. Mott's Medley's all natural fruit snacks are yummy as well and are made with both fruit and vegetable juices! The Mott's ones are also not organic, and not quite as soft as the Ocean Spray or Annie's, but again, much less expensive.",2.0

"Quinoa is a delicious and more nutritional version of rice and cooks very easily. It is probably the most nutritional grain because of it high protein (12-18%), fiber, phosphorus, iron and magnesium content. The protein in Quinoa is complete with all amino acids (unlike rice which lacks in lysine) which makes it an excellent grain for vegetarians.<br /><br />I cooked Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa just like rice and it was ready in 20 minutes. You have to rinse it well otherwise the grains are sticky. Soaking in water before cooking, like rice, also helps. It can be used in a variety of ways just-hot with meals and cold with salad - like rice. It is very sumptuous, filling and has somewhat nutty flavor.<br /><br />For people who do not like the flavor, it can be mixed with rice 30/70 or 40/60 and Quinoa flavor is masked by rice. The biggest downside to Quinoa is that it does not store well: I found fungus in air tight container after 6 months and bugs in a container that was not air tight.",2.0

Like I read on another reviewer's summary - some of the artichoke hearts were tough and I had to discard parts of the hearts. Not the best quality I have had. What they should have done was trim them a little more so that the hard tough parts were not there - I guess they wanted to cheap it out a little and include parts that would have been thrown out if you were making them from fresh Artichokes.

But the less then positive reviews were right, against the hype.  I do like that its natural and organic...but it needs way more cheese!  Although the shells that had a bit more cheese on them tasted good, the overall taste seemed like I added too much milk, even though I used far less than the recommended 1/4 cup.  I give it a meh rating.  I would also go so far as to say these should have a regular price of that $.50 as well, sad to say.  I am curious about the other varieties though...sure wish it had more cheese...",1.0
"Sometimes I feel sorry for our dogs having to eat the same kibble every day. We can tell that they also hate having the same stuff every day. One of the worst problems for a dog owner is getting them to eat once they become disenchanted with their fare. The problem s that once we lose them, they stay lost. But with this dry food they take an interest and dinnertime becomes competitive once agin as everyone tries to glom the kibble so as to deny the other a good meal. And we'd rather see that than watch them ignore their food altogether.",1.0

"Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'.  At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected.",2.0

"I must preface my review with the point that I'm not sure if these were out of date; I do not have the best of faith in the seller from whom I bought them. If they were not extremely old, however, I would say they are not very powerful or effective. When I have purchased other moth traps (I have tried four different brands) the pheromone pads always have a distinct odor immediately upon opening the packet of the most effective ones. These exuded no smell whatsoever. Also, the better ones begin catching moths immediately. A moth circled the vicinity of this trap for a good hour without feeling enticed enough to go inside. The next day, not one moth is in the trap. Finally, the sticky surface inside the trap is not the stickiest I've seen and does not cover the entire inside of the trap. Definitely would not recommend.",0.0

This has a very mild flavor to it and no bitter after taste. If you want it stronger you can just let the bag steep longer.

"Compared to the Mojito Crystal Light Mocktail, this product -- the Margarita Mocktail -- is a disappointment.  The flavors are not clear or intense and it is more like a not too sweet kool-aid than a margarita.  Now, I have to admit that I have strong preferences about margaritas and I prefer them strong and with nothing but tequila, cointreau and real lime juice.  The sweet mixes that are used to make so many margaritas sold in restaurants and bars are not my cup of tea (or margarita!).  For those many who do enjoy the restaurant variety margarita the Crystal Light Margarita Mocktail might be just their cup of tea.  It has the same flavor and if made into a slushy in the blender it would taste very like the frozen margaritas found in restaurants but without the calories.  I would suggest adding less water if you are going to make a slushy since it would be too watered down otherwise.  All in all this is an interesting new product.",1.0

"This was an ok bar.  Not my favorite of the Kashi line-up, but still not bad in a pinch when I have nothing else for breakfast.<br /><br />The chocolate almond bar tasted mainly of chocolate.  In fact, I really didn't taste the almonds at all.  I'm sure they added to the crunchy texture, but predominately I tasted the other grains in there all liberally coated with a milk chocolate.  This was made even more chocolatey by the thick coating on the bottom as well.  So all in all, definitely chocolate if you couldn't tell from the description thus far.  I do enjoy the crunchy aspects of this particular type of bar as well, but compared to the Chocolate Pretzel and some of the other ones, I don't think it was quite as crunchy as it could have been.<br /><br />These are definitely a fitness bar.  8 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and 170 calories are packed right in.  This makes it the perfect choice for exercise or as a meal replacement.  I wouldn't recommend just snacking on it when you're hungry.  Choose a lower calorie snack for that type of meal.  Sugars are 13 grams, which isn't high, but it isn't the diabetic special either.<br /><br />Ingredients are alright.  It doesn't boast the organic ingredients that some bars too, but it does have that Kashi special seven whole grains ingredient in it.  The main sweetener is brown rice syrup and there is some evaporated cane juice crystals and fructose as well.  They also add some vitamins such as folic acid and zinc oxide into the blend too.  And of course there are almonds in this bar, so those with nut allergies should probably steer clear.<br /><br />Not a bad bar but I'd choose other flavors over this one.  There just wasn't anything special or unique seeming about it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",1.0
"We eat a lot of peanut butter in this house, between kidlets, people with ""sugar"" issues, and just plain loving peanut butter.<br /><br />I also love peanuts, and will not eat any peanut but Planets if given the option.<br /><br />I was excited to see that Planters had decided to market a peanut butter.<br /><br />Unfotunately.... their expertise in peanuts did not quite translate to the butter form.<br /><br />Pro - Smoother than any I have ever had or used. Nothing is easier to spread.<br /><br />Con - It just didn't taste ""right."" I am not sure what was ""off"" to me, but it just wasn't right.<br /><br />That said, peanut butter is a very personal experience, and I would recommend that anybody who enjoys peanut butter give this version a try.

"Finally, a k-cup that actually tastes like a ""real"" cup of coffee.  However, keep in mind you cannot use your normal k-cup ""display"" set up that most of you have.  You must keep these k-cups sealed in an airtight container to keep them fresh, as they do not have the plastic housing you are use to.  Perhaps this is why the coffee actually tastes like coffee.  Stick to the Foghouse blend - it's stronger and richer tasting than the other.  The cost is less, most likely because the plastic is missing.  You have a normal coffee filter-type-fabric encasing the coffee. Looks different than your normal k-cup, but tastes soooo much better.  I'm glad I read a review and purchased this product.  Hope you do too.",2.0
"Taste : 4 stars<br />Convenience : 4 stars<br />Authenticity : 2.5 stars<br />Healthiness : 1 star!<br /><br />Rendang is an Indonesian style meat curry. I've eaten the dish in restaurants in Singapore (though never in Indonesia), and I've also tried this exact sauce mix a few years ago, and I thought it turned out better the last time. For rendang, it was too wet, and too sweet. However, if you don't try to compare it for authenticity, it does taste very good.<br /><br />The coconut power was a bit difficult to mix well. I should have tried what another reviewer suggested - to whisk it with water separately before mixing it. Perhaps I should have tried cooking it longer to allow more of the liquid to evaporate. The instructions only said to cook till it reached the desired doneness.<br /><br />You can substitute the beef with lamb as well if that's your preference. It doesn't make it any healthier, but it gives it a different flavor.<br /><br />I wish I can eat this more often, but one look at the nutritional information will tell you why that's not a good idea. It doesn't look too bad, until you reach ""Servings per container : 15""! A previous reviewer mentioned that it is impossible to eat the entire packet in one sitting. I agree, but I can eat half a packet without too much effort, which should be enough saturated fat and cholesterol to last me through a week.",1.0

"If you like sour apple Jolly Rangers and want to drink a beverage flavored as such, then this mix is for you.  The drink's aftertaste took me a little getting used too, but after I drank a couple glasses, I got used to it.  I don't normally drink low calorie drinks, except soda.  Another boon to this product is that you can mix it as a real cocktail.  The key to it is using a little of the powder and blending with a tiny bit of water, then adding vodka and ice to it.  It still has an aftertaste to get used to, but I prefer it over the regular sugary Sour Apple Pucker or other mixers.  It just takes some time to figure out the ratio of powder to water in order for the finished cocktail not to taste watered down.  If you mix a full 2 quart pitcher and then add vodka, it does taste watered down, so a much more concentrated amount is needed.<br /><br />But the drink without it tastes pretty good.  I find it cooling on a hot day.  It would be good for people who have to avoid alcohol, since it does make a decant mocktail.",2.0

"I was curious to try this, as the ""Honey"" part caught my eye. I have tried the previous edition that had the aspartame, and it had a strange aftertaste that I wasn't fond of. I like to have little packets like this to keep in my purse or in the car though, and the flavor sounded pretty good.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I read the box. I wanted to see what the ingredient list was. And so I must say, if you're looking for something with no artificial sweetener at all - BEWARE. This does not have aspartame, but it DOES have sucralose (otherwise known as SPLENDA). I was a bit disappointed when I read that, as I was hoping it was just honey as the sweetener.<br /><br />However, I went ahead and made some - I even measured out the 16.9oz so that my initial taste-test could be as accurate as possible. I smelled the packet when I first opened and could definitely smell the mango. The pineapple was less pronounced. Then I the water in a glass container with a lid (I wanted to see how well it dissolved). One good shake and I could still see some bits (probably the honey) floating around. Two more really good shakes and other than a small bit in the bottom, it was all dissolved. I opened the lid of the container and took another smell - again, very strong mango, with a bit of pineapple. It smelled really good. As for the taste - it lives up to the smell. I really like it. I don't get any aftertaste from the sucralose, and the fruit flavors are not too strong. It's not overly sweet, though that is individual taste and can be easily fixed by adding a bit more water.<br /><br />Overall, despite my disappointment with the addition of sucralose (which is why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5), I would happily buy this. It tastes delicious, can be adjusted for taste, dissolves easily, and is convenient to carry around.",1.0

"My little girl loves Quaker oatmeal and I love how easy it is to make. Here is how I make it: 1. open package into microwaveable glass or ceramic bowl. 2. Pour milk over mix. I can eyeball it now, but it's just a tiny bit more than what is recommended on the package instructions. 3. stir well. 4. microwave for one minute on high power (ten). 5. stir. 6. microwave on medium high (seven) power for one minute (depends on your microwave, you work it out). 7. stir. 8. repeat step six. 7. Stir, pour onto flat plate to allow to cool down more quickly.<br /><br />If I see that it's too thick after step 6, I add a little milk. If it doesn't stick to the spoon at least a little by the end of step 6, you used too much milk. Usually we like cinnamon sprinkled on top.",1.0

"I'm another one of those people who have looked for years, without success, to find Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup on the grocery store shelves.  But, by searching on the internet recently, I came across the soup for sale on Amazon.  Others, as well as myself, have wondered if the product was fresh stock since it's very hard to find.  Well, I recently called Campbell's to inquire if the soup was still in production, and they assured me it was.  So, last fall, I ordered 2 cases of the soup on Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H136JY"">Campbell's Beefy Mushroom, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and the expiration was in 2011 or 2012 (I forget).  I've already used up all the soup and I'm ready to order more.  When this soup first appeared in grocery stores years ago, the label had this YUMMY recipe on it, which I have used ever since.  It is my husband's favorite hamburger dish.  This recipe transforms ordinary hamburger into a delicious comfort food your family is sure to love.  It's so easy to make, but ohhh sooo good!  Here it is:<br /><br />""Campbell's Salisbury Steak""<br /><br />1 (10 3/4 ounce) can Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup<br />1 1/2 lbs ground beef<br />1 egg, lightly beaten<br />1/2 c. fine dry breadcrumbs<br />1/4 c. finely chopped onion<br />1/8 t. pepper<br />1/4 c. water<br /><br />1) Add 1/4 c. soup, egg, breadcrumbs, onion and pepper to the ground beef and mix well.<br />2) Shape into 6 patties.<br />3) Brown both sides in ungreased skillet, over medium heat; not cooking them completely.<br />4) Drain off the fat.<br />5) Spoon over the patties the undiluted Beefy-Mushroom soup and 1/4 c. water.<br />6) Cover the skillet and simmer over low heat 20 minutes or until done, spooning the gravy over the patties occasionally.<br />7) Delicious served with mashed potatoes, cooked green beans and rolls with butter.<br /><br />Serves 6",2.0

"This was an extremely affordable item, but the old adage you get what you pay for applies here.  The coffee was nothing special and tasted like discount coffee.  One of the best aspects of the single-cup coffee maker is that you get a cup of coffee that is strong (depending upon your preference), fresh and, tastes like a cup of coffee from one of the chain reatil locations, without the retail price. This coffee tasted like weak, old coffee - coffee that was made in a drip maker.  In my opinion, not a ""Fog Chaser"" at all.",0.0

As one other review states the bag was ripped when it arrived. No problem with the food but if it continues I would question the packaging. I am lucky I opened the box on the counter and food spilled into box. I would have hated to lose any. The food itself I have fed my dogs before. Very good product and my dogs love it. I went to a cheaper brand due to financial concerns but not happy with that food. Will stick with this brand. The price is cheaper then local pet-store and the convenience of home delivery is a perk!

"I have given my child a wide variety of fruits and vegetables so far, and this is the only food that we have offered him that he has flat out refused.  I try everything that I give him, and I almost gagged when I tasted this.  The mint taste is very overpowering.  I was not expecting mint to be mixed with green beans and peas.  But I did not want to force my likes and dislikes on to my son, so I sent this off to daycare with him and also stashed an extra pouch of organic carrots in his bag just in case.  Needless to say, my son came home with a full pouch of this, an empty pouch of carrots, and a note saying that he absolutely refused to eat this.  They even tried to trick him and dip the peas/beans in to the carrots and it was still a no go.  My son eats up peas alone, but there is something about this combination that does not work.",0.0

This treat, combined with the Everlasting Treat Ball is such a great solution.  My dog (about 60 lbs, Dalmation) has so much fun trying to get this out of the ball, and he seems to love the taste of the Vanilla Mint more than any others.  This takes him a while to eat, but also isn't a lot of food.  it's a pretty decent sized treat.  When I first got it, it took him a while to get the treat all the way out, even days!

I felt this was a bit too sweet. It has no added sugar, and zero calories, but does contain an artificial sweetner. It also had a slight medicinal taste. I tried adjusting the amount I put in, but it either tasted like nothing or too sweet.  The directions say the bottle must be refrigerated and used within thirty days. Unless you used this several times per day, I doubt you would use this up in a month.

"We recently added a cat to our family. We have never had a cat, so cat litter was a learning process. I tried many brands and have decided, hands down, that Feline Pine is the best.

I imagined the cats gnawing on it,<br />rolling it, etc etc.  Well, they are only partially interested. Part of the problem might be that<br />it blends in to our carpet really well.

But I think they have better vision than I do, so I think it is more ME that<br />has a hard time seeing it than they do!<br /><br />There is mild interest. Cat 1 will occasionally look at it, give it a lick or two, and move along.<br />Cat 2 will swat it once in a while, trying to get it to roll under my son's bed where she has one<br />of her stashes of toys, but that's all. She doesn't chew or lick it.<br /><br />Both are catnip addicts, so it isn't that they don't respond to the nip.

"I think I'm pretty well-qualified to comment on the taste of coconut water, having been drinking it since I was a young on visits to India.  Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst.",0.0

"Ordered this item as I am trying to eat more healthy. Was very skeptical at first coz of all  the reviews on the taste but I thought that I would give it a shot. I ordered the Mango Pomegranate Infusion and was not disappointed. It is green alright and looked like swamp water, but it has a good flavor to it ( I mixed it with water to avoid extra calories ). The consistency is not too thick or grainy either. I prefer this more than the other green stuff I had in the past. I think that I will continue drinking it once a day from now on. Hopefully it will do what it claims or your health<br /><br />Update; so today 1/22/12 is my second day drinking this swamp water looking thing and I have to say that I like it even more. It has a flavor, but just a hint..a note of fruit flavor in it which is why I like. It is not heavily sweetened and not over powering. If you are expecting a strong fruit flavor to cover up the green, then look elsewhere. For me, I really like it.<br /><br />One month later,2/20/12, I can feel that I am in a very healthy stage of my life.

"As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea, I highly recommend Stash's regular green tea. That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh ""green"" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.<br /><br />PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them.",0.0

"I am unable to remember exactly how I came across these, but try them I did. When you hit the fruit flavors you are readily reminded of Jelly Belly jelly beans. Given that Bertie Bott's Beans are made by Jelly Belly, your taste buds would be correct. So, what makes these particular Jelly Belly jelly beans different from regular Jelly Bellys? The bizarre flavors, of course.<br /><br />I think I had a vomit bean in my box, but I did not think it was that bad. I also had dirt, which tasted like I thought dirt should taste like. The sardine flavored beans tasted just like fish; strongly like fish. Unfortunately, I got too many of the sardine flavored beans, so I think I have had enough of those. The grass flavored beans tasted like grass. I was able to reasonably handle all these flavors except for the earthworm, which is just gross. I have had real earthworms before, and they did not taste as bad as these jelly beans did.<br /><br />I am amazed at how authentic the Bertie Bott's Beans tasted. I warn you that they taste so authentic that you may wish you had not eaten them. For children, who often like such things, these candies may be a perfect gift, especially for male children. These candies may be great for someone interested in some sort of a contest.

"This might seem like an absurd idea, chocolate-flavored vinegar, and I can reassure you that the uses described on this product page -- especially marinating meats -- are guaranteed to nauseate your gourmet family and guests. But there is an interesting use for this and for the other Xtreme balsamics ... in home-made ice cream!<br /><br />Vinegar-flavored ice creams are currently a flourishing fad in parts of Europe, especially in Spain. The idea is to streak thin veins of vinegar through an otherwise too simpering a flavor. Balsamic works very well with strawberry, which is normally too sweet for my taste. This chocolate balsamic works in only very specific flavor contexts: with medium dark chocolate, with raspberry, with orange or blood orange (ice cream, not sorbet). Of course, you can experiment in any way you like. If you never make ice cream, or if somebody gives you a bottle of this stuff for the holiday, you're on your own.

"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",2.0

"Both my dogs love these treats.  They have both tried the salmon and the chicken flavor.  The only reason we didn't try the peanut-butter flavored ones is because they already get peanut butter in their kongs as a treat, so we used salmon and chicken as a ""variety.""<br /><br />Great for treats in general, and also perfect for training!<br />For training purposes - we actually cut them into fourths (we have a picky yorkie and a puppy who will be a medium sized dog).  At 3.5 calories per treat - cut into FOURTHS - I am happy to give them as many as they need during training sessions without worrying too much about feeding them too many treats and spoiling their mealtime!  Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.  But currently he still likes to take a few happy chews of his 1/4-zuke!<br /><br />They are quite odorous (which is probably why the dogs love them so much) - so it maybe takes some time to get used to the first few times you are digging into the treat bag.

Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.

"First of all I would like to say that my puppy LOVES this food! I have a 4 month old Lhasa Apso and he licks his bowl well after he has finished eating. When I first got him the breeder had him on Purina Puppy Chow. The first thing I wanted to do was to switch him to a high quality, no grain diet and after alot of research and reviews,Taste of The Wild always came on top(dollar wise). After the switch I immediately noticed a difference in my puppy.His coat is starting to shine and is sooooo soft to the touch. He has so much energy now and he has less eye discharge and less ear odor(due to being allergic to the Puppychow). My only problem I have with this product is when I went to my local pet store to buy him a 15lb bag. I immediately saw on the bag ""Now made with Purified Water and More Bison"" and I thought to myself; ""wow they made it better"", but after reading the ingredients boy was I wrong. They might have added more bison but they totally eliminated venison from the list. Venison was the second ingredient but now its lamb meal. What once this dog food had four meat products as its main ingredients(Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal) now has three(Bison, lamb meal, chicken meal). More bison or not the exclusion of venison takes away some of the ""wildness"" of the formula in my opinion. Sure it still has roasted venison down the list but it just that, DOWN the list. In my opinion they've downgraded the formula but are still charging the same price and I am a little concerned by that. I emailed the company for more info on the ""New Formula"" before I buy the bag and will post an update soon.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />Just received an email regrading the formula change by the company;<br /><br />Dear Eric,<br /><br />""Thank you for your inquiry. I'm glad that your puppy has been doing so well on the Taste of the Wild High Prairie. The formula had to be changed because an adequate supply of quality venison was not available. The change is relatively minor with the venison being replaced with bison, already a part of the recipe. I would not expect you to notice a difference with your puppy. However, if you still have some of the food in the previous bag, I would mix the food from both bags for a few days to avoid any potential issues. If you do not have any food from the previous bag, you could add some plain nonfat yogurt to your puppy's diet for a few days to help prevent any issues. I usually recommend 1 tablespoon per 25 pounds body weight"".<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />--<br />Melissa Brookshire, DVM<br /><br />Just to let you guys know that the formula change might cause some minor stomach issues so adjust accordantly.",1.0

"For me, the CLEAR product line has been a mixed bag ranging from really nice to not so nice. I received this early this morning and used it before I bathed  This product has given me a problem. There were no instructions for usage so I used this as a pre-treatment. I dampened my hair and applied two quarter sized globs on my hair. I massaged it lightly on the scalp and then combed it through my shoulder length hair. I put a plastic shower cap on and gave it a half hour to absorb. Right now my hair is pretty dry as well as over exposed to sun and salt water. My hair is also straight and extremely fine.<br />I showered and washed my hair. It felt smooth and soft in the shower, however as it started air drying I realized that my hair was seriously greasy.

My hair is still over moisturized but presentable at least.<br />I can't recommend this product based on my experience using it.

"I have been buying these chicken jerky treats every month via Amazon's subscription for the past six months and the bags aren't enough for the three dogs and one cat who love these treats.  All I have to do is shake one of these bags and all four come running into the kitchen.  Even the well-behaved old girl walks in hoping for her treat.<br /><br />These are the only treats I feed my dogs.  They don't get junk dog biscuits or fake sausages that smell like turpentine.  All they get are these treats, two a day per dog.  When I take them out hiking, they get extra treats for extra energy.<br /><br />The cat always insist on his own slivver, too.<br /><br />These treats are easy to pack, don't spoil easily, don't smell and are a lightweight and healthy treat for any four-legged pet. Sure, the treats are a bit pricy but my pets are worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE 24 Feb 2012:  My subscription over the past year kept going up, from a very reasonable USD 19 to a shocking USD 28.  That last price hike was just too much so I cancelled my S&S and am now buying a competitor's product that is much more affordable.  I took a star away because this product is now longer affordable.",1.0

They love the abundant chunks of meat and I think it adds a little variety to their meals.

"I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a ""candy dish"" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces.",1.0

"While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more ""exposed"" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this ""OneCup"" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a ""house"" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant.",0.0
"I am a coffee lover and usually enjoy a strong cappuccino in the morning.  I tried this coffee and was impressed by the aroma and flavor.  It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.

I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again.",1.0
"I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these ""MINI WHITE ROUNDS"" and an equivalent order of ""TATO SKINS"".  The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!

"I love the idea of the Lickety Stik:  a dog treat without all the extra calories.  Unfortunately, the design of this product makes it difficult to use.  The roller ball is very firmly fitted into the top so that it doesn't really roll.

My two dogs quickly figured out what to do with this ""treat"", and they will lick and lick, but nothing comes out unless I either (1) squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out (which then usually drips onto the floor) or (2) move the roller ball with my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept that needs a little tweaking in the execution.",1.0

It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging.

"I have been drinking vitamin water and sobe Lifewater for awhile but that can get expensive so I started drinking just plain water, filtered from my fridge's water dispenser.  Plain water is so boring so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />First of all, remember that this is concentrated!  so you MUST mix it with water.  When I got it I wasn't really sure how big of a ""squeeze"" to put in.  It says on the label ""one squeeze per 8 oz water""  - well, my first 'squeeze' I just did a full grip and squeezed until I couldn't squeen anymore.  For me that was a bit too much flavor and it tasted like Hawaiian Punch.  So the next time I backed off a bit and after a few uses I found a ""squeeze"" level that works for me tastes.<br /><br />I also like to add it to small bottles of water that I occasionally get from the store.  I just drink a little out of a 16.9oz water bottle then put in a squeeze of the Vitamin squeeze, shake it a bit and I've got a nice, flavorful and vitamin-enhanced drink.  I'm not too sure there are 24 servings in one bottle, maybe my squeeze is too much, but I've probably had at least a dozen water drinks with this one bottle and still have some left.  I'll try keeping tabs with the next bottle I open and update this review.<br /><br />Oh, I enjoyed the fruit punch so much that I decided to try the Acai Grape Pomegranate and the Tropical Citrus.  The Acai Grape Pomegranate is okay, but I think the Tropical Citrus and the Fruit punch are my favorites thus far.  The Tropical Citrus is a bit like ""Sunny Delight"" - if you've ever tried that.<br /><br />As for the claim of ""Specially designed cap delivers the right amount in one squeeze with no drips or mess"" - I would say again that you have to determine what ""one squeeze"" is to suit your taste and it definitely is no drips or mess!  A lot better than pouring those powder packets in to a bottle and getting the powder on your counter top or desk.",2.0
"I always buy Bigelow's green tea (which aside from the need to use two teabags per cup due to weakness, is satisfactory). Still, I thought I'd give Stash's a go. I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as ""grassy""? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one.",0.0
"I may have gotten a bad batch, but these tasted stale to me. I'm also frustrated with poor marketing. Is this a cereal, or a snack? If it's meant to just be a snack, it falls very short. There were few actual clusters,and the rest was loose bits of grain, etc. That could have worked in milk with a spoon, but the packaging seemed to indicate it's a snack food. I have no idea what's 'kind' about it, and I don't like the push for grains to be considered 'required' in anyone's diet. The original studies that showed fiber was important for digestion were all studies on VEGETABLE fibers in real whole foods, not in processed grains.

"Ok, I agree that there was a strong scent of nutmeg when you opened the bag, but I don't find it overpowers the flavor of the muffin. But, I like nutmeg and keep whole nutmegs to freshly grate into my baking, so I might not be the best to say it's not too overpowering.<br /><br />The first time I made these I didn't pay enough attention to the instructions. I figured hand mixing would probably be fine, and my batter was super thick. I made 'coffee cake' muffins with a layer of streusel inside, then a little on top. They completely caved in and while they actually tasted good they were a huge crumbly mess and had holes in the center.<br /><br />The second time I made them I did it exactly as instructed and they turned out great. I put in 1.5C of fresh blueberries and they did sink to the bottom. I found that to be too many as well, it was just a mouthful of blueberry in the lower half and no cake. Next time I'll just use fewer blueberries. But they rose well, stayed in one piece (so long as I was gentle with them, not for toddler hands), and tasted fantastic! I would say almost the same as gluteny muffins. They were light, airy, spongy, and delicious. I sprinkled the tops with a touch of plain white sugar just for fun.<br /><br />I'll make these again and again. I like not having to mix out a million flours and starches that are light as air and fly all over my kitchen when I make homemade recipes. So I'll take the convenience, I think King Arthur hit the mark on these!<br /><br />4/5 stars b/c if you follow the instructions, they are a total pain to make, to be honest, and b/c they don't really brown on top, take a little longer than expected to bake, and still have a tendency to crumble if you're not careful.

Yes, I realize that crab is a seafood, but it's just a fishy type of soup and I don't like that.  To each his own!",0.0
"My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect. I'm usually not much of a coffee drinker, I need it sweet or extremely smooth, so I was happy to find that this coffee was not as bitter as most. For those who need a nice, fresh easy coffee, I think this is perfect.<br /><br />It's important to note that these packets are for pod brewers, not your regular 8-10 cup coffee maker. They come conveniently packaged and my first thought upon opening them was that they're perfect for the small business! Hotels, bed & breakfasts, small offices, etc would all love this style of coffee that is convenient and individually made. I would definitely recommend it for someone in need of a good coffee for use at their small business. But also if you're a 1-cup a day sort of drinker, or someone who occasionally likes to make a very small pot of coffee--this is the perfect set up for you!",1.0

Even so, knowing that many things can go wrong in breadmaking, I may try it again, but I would certainly not be willing to pay the price here just to check my first opinion.

"This product has changed from the original that my dogs loved. These are NOT wrapped in chicken as the packaging and product description will have you believe. This is my 2nd attempt to get the old product without success. Evidently, these have replaced the quality product we used to receive. When I opened them I discovered these flimsy strips of rawhide that are now painted with this mystery substance. The rawhide is like very thin cardboard. There is absolutely NO chicken on these. I contacted Beefeaters and they have not responded. This company is advertising falsely and making a huge profit on this garbage!! Save your money and start looking for a new product.

"I have a 4yr old 30lb male beagle mix who absolutely LOVES these chews. I had originally bought them for the sole purpose of promoting good dental health, thinking my dog might chew on them if he got bored or if it was the only chew I gave him. You see, he's usually very picky- he won't chew antlers or bones, unflavored rawhide, nylabones, and though he'll lick peanut butter out of a kong, he doesn't do much if I put a treat in there.  To my surprise, as soon as my dog smells these chews, he can hardly control himself, he get so excited! They smell a little funky (meaty), but I think that's all part of what makes my dog love these chews.<br /><br />This is great for us, since it means he gets an after-dinner treat he loves, they have helped keep his teeth relatively plaque free, and they help keep his breath from smelling bad. Of course, his mouth doesn't exactly smell like your favorite flower (unless your favorite flower smells like dog breath), but I have noticed that the distance at which I start to smell my dog's stinky dog-breath has shortened significantly, and his breath no longer causes people distress from a distance. Also nice is that these chews last a little while. For my dog, they will keep him occupied for around 15 minutes. This is great compared to the Kong brand fresh breath treats, which my dog chewed through right away, and they did very little for his teeth.<br /><br />To address other reviewers' comments, I should caution that my dog is somewhat small at 30lbs, and he is an incredibly patient chewer (though he will chew for very long periods of time). He will calmly chew his rawhides, etc, until he gets nice small pieces to swallow, and he avoids pieces that are too big to swallow, so these treats present little choking hazard for him. I understand the issue though, and I'd recommend that you treat these like any other thin rawhide squares, which is to say that they are a pretty big hazard for choking or for your dog swallowing large un-chewed pieces (which can cause an upset tummy). As with any rawhide-type treat, you should supervise your dog when you give these to them, especially the first few times. My biggest complaint of these chews is that I think they would last longer and be less of a choking hazard if they came as twists or rolls, instead of flat pieces, since the flat pieces are pretty easy to break.<br /><br />Since too much of a good thing is usually a bad thing, I also try to limit the number of these chews I give to my dog, since they appear to very similar to beef hide, and I don't want to give him too many hide chews. So, I give him one of these every other day, depending on the other treats he has had that day, and I alternate with greenies or other dental-type chews, so he has a variety of chews, but he gets some sort of dental health chew every day.",1.0

"I really like this Namaste Foods ""Say Cheez"" gluten free, vegan macaroni and cheese style dinner. It's not Kraft Mac & Cheese but I like it a lot better than Kraft! It's zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese.<br /><br />I thought that the 3 tablespoons of oil they say to mix the ""cheez"" sauce with was excessive.  I used one teaspoon of oil and 1/2 cup of the cooking water I reserved from the pasta and let it simmer while stirring for a few minutes to thicken.  Then I added the pasta and green beans that I cooked with the pasta.  It was really tasty!  The macaroni, which was a nice texture and cooked up beautifully, has ridges to hold the sauce.  Do not over cook the pasta though, it needs maybe 8 1/2 or 9 minutes.<br /><br />It's just way too expensive.  I really think Namaste Foods could make money and still price this much better to be affordable for the average person.  No need to price gouge people who have food sensitivities and parents who have children with Celiac Disease.  I know this type of product costs more to produce because of the need for a dedicated facility and the special ingredients but your prices are ridiculous.<br /><br />Most families are on a strict budget especially in these days of poor economy and job losses.  Even on Subscribe & Save this product was almost $4 a bag!  Come on Namaste Foods.  You don't understand the meaning of ""Namaste"" if you charge such exorbitant prices.",1.0
"As some of the other reviewers have noted, Baby's Only Organic Formula contains high levels of arsenic. I would love to have exclusively breastfed, but, due to a low milk supply that couldn't meet my baby's needs, I have to supplement with formula. I did a ton of research before buying Baby's Only and thought I was giving my baby the next best thing to breastmilk. I didn't want to buy Earth's Best because it contains hexane. Baby's Only was the only organic formula I could find without hexane. So I was appalled when I learned that Baby's Only dairy formula tested for high levels of arsenic (read the story on the Boston Globe's website: ""Arsenic hidden in baby formula, cereal bars, and energy shots?"") due to the brown rice syrup in it. Baby's Only hasn't issued a recall, voluntary or otherwise. I cannot believe this formula is still being sold. DO NOT BUY BABY'S ONLY. I ended up ordering another organic formula called Holle from a website in Germany. It's not available in the US, but the international shipping cost was worth it for my baby's health.",0.0

"I had been using the Nordic Ware Microwave Popcorn popper with one of the Fireworks popcorn varieties that was supposed to be best popped in the microwave. I wasn't happy with all the old maids that were left in the bottom of the bowl. I used the reviews and found this organic popcorn, and I'm so glad I did. I like that this popcorn is organic, and comes in 20 oz resealable bags which keeps it nice and fresh, and easy to transport (beach trip). The most important things that I like about this popcorn is that it pops huge, fluffy, and flavorful. I had been able to use a half cup of the Fireworks popcorn without it ever nearing the top of the popper bowl. The first time I popped the Eden Organic Yellow popcorn with a half cup portion it literally popped the top off of the popper. Eden's Organic Yellow popcorn pops much bigger, and had very few old maids left in the bowl. I'm able to use a quarter of a cup of popcorn to get a full bowl. One other benefit to the Eden Organic Yellow popcorn over the Fireworks brand I was using is that the popcorn isn't as hard on the teeth. You still get a crunch just not a hard crunch, and less hulls between the teeth. Try the Eden's Organic Yellow popcorn with confidence. I think you'll be happy with the results. To get a great bowl of popcorn I use the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil with some Jolly Time Buttery seasoning...yum, yum, yum!",2.0
"I love a good spicy kick in foods, and needless to say this didn't disappoint in giving the ol' kick, however since this is regarded as the spiciest pepper in the world I was a little dissapointed that I didn't end up going to the hospital after eating it. Most spicy stuff just tastes good to me with a slight tingle, tobasco for example is just barely spicy and is about a 2 on a 1-10 scale. This stuff is about an 8 or 9, and while it didn't make me call 911 it put me in a scorched coma for a bit.<br /><br />First bite was a cautious little nibble, a slight tingle but nothing much. After awhile of nothing I ripped off about half of it and ate it, and while it numbed my mouth a bit once it hit my stomach, well... now I know how Mr. Orange felt throughout Reservoir Dogs. It just sat in my stomach in the same place burning like a damn minituare sun, burning away. So the peppers certainly work well for 'dares' or whatever circumstance it is where you're only eating the pepper.<br /><br />Mixing them with foods is a different story, the peppers have a great dried delicious quality, and they look just like the picture so you can imagine the texture. The heat is great too since it doesn't overwhelm the other flavors, it's rather subtle like an infernal landmine waiting to go off in your mouth. If you like spicy foods it's a great addition to your kitchen, and if you want to prank someone or go on a dare or whatever, these peppers work for that too.",1.0

The instructions called for adding 6oz hot water. I added 8oz but still thought the taste was quite strong. You could probably dilute it with 12oz and be fine.

"Don't mean to be the one who rains on the bandwagon (pardon the metaphor crash), but, while it is definitely true what other reviewers have written -- that the coffee is very strong, very thick, and very dark (add in an acid level commensurate with the sludge-factor) -- I don't find the taste all that strong, and taste is important.<br /><br />True, these K-Cups will provide a pleasant-tasting beverage the consistency and color of Louisiana mud, but for taste, one can do a lot better.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had K-cups of coffee back-to-back today, one of this type and one of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1CC02"">Keurig K-Cup ""Mini-Brewers"" Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold</a>, which is, unfortunately, sold out at the moment.  True, Newman's (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste.  It's a lot ""Bold""er than this brand.<br /><br />One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the ""Big Easy Bold"" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf.  Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and selecting my own brand and grind.

"Let me start by saying that I am not a sweet potato fan, however, my daughter and husband are, and since we are always looking for healthier snacks, this looked like a good option. There are only 3 grams of fat in a .8 oz snack bag, so they are much better for you then regular chips and if I remember correctly, are even healthier than the regular potato popchips. Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.<br /><br />When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall.

"I had a cough and sore throat when I tried the peppermint mocha latte. I didn't know if it was such a great idea to try it when I didn't feel well, but the mint appealed to me.<br /><br />I followed the directions and mixed 4 tsp. with about 8 ounces of steaming hot water. I was happy to see that it mixed well - I didn't come across any lumps of unmixed granules while drinking or at the bottom when I was done. There's a nice frothiness to it. And I was right: The peppermint is very soothing. I felt a bit revived after the first few sips. The peppermint is not strong or overwhelming, but it does linger, which I liked. The mocha is very subtle; what stands out is the peppermint. It's just a really nice mix of hot drink with a gentle, chocolate-tinged minty coolness.<br /><br />I don't really have any gripes, because I'm the one who made the drink, but I do think the next time I make a mug of peppermint mocha, I will add another half teaspoon or so - it's not that the drink I made was bad, but I found I wanted it just a touch stronger. The flavor is that good. With 9 carbs and 7 sugars per mug, I felt better health-wise about enjoying it, too. Easy to recommend!",1.0

"I bought this tea for the health benefits, and although I am not the biggest fan of tea, I knew that this tea was extremely overbearing and is very hard to drink. This team smelled like perfume, as well as tasted like it. It left my mouth smelling like I drank a bottle of perfume and it just wasn't pleasant at all. I can usually handle things that taste bad, but this was an exception. If you can get over the strong taste, however, I'm sure you'll be fine.",0.0

"Like the other reviewers, I agree that dog treats made in china are potentially poisonous, and should be avoided at all costs.  My dog is too precious to me to even take the risk.  Chinese people eat dogs, they don't care about yours.  I urge all consumers to send emails to Waggin Train AND Milos Kitchen and let them know these products are NOT ACCEPTABLE to Americans.  There's no reason why hard-working Americans can't make tasty dog treats, and we would make them with love instead of poison.  I WOULD pay a little more if these treats were American.

"We have both a medium and a large version of this toy.  We initially bought the medium for our Presa Canario (Bella) when she was a puppy. She had a great time nibbling and trying to get the treat out but was unable to. We lost the toy and a couple months.  Later when we found it, our puppy had grown considerably and could easily pop the treats out and attempt to swallow them whole.  As a result, we decided the toy was too small for her and gave it to our Norwegian Elkhound (Nikki) who also loved it.  It took her several hours but she was also able to pop the treats out but being a mature dog knew better than to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />Later, we decided to buy the large one for Bella and she absolutely had a blast with it.  After hours she would be able to pop the treat out but we pop it back in and she would have to work at it some more.<br /><br />I would say this is a great toy for dogs that need stimulation and like to chew and rip things up.  Although the treat can be popped out by both of our dogs the ball itself has survived several refills and weeks of play.  This is not a toy i would leave the dog unattended with.  If you do leave them unattended they will probably pop the treat out and eat it the first day you get it.  Keep an eye on them and be there to grab the treat and pop it back in and they will get hours of focused play with this toy.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to get the treats out of the large toy so even if you have a smaller dog it is a good idea to go ahead and get the larger version. Bella and Nikki definitely would recommend this toy. They both love it.<br /><br />One small downside other than the treats popping out, the dogs do quite a bit of drooling with this toy.  In the case of Bella, we had to establish that it was a toy she could only have while in the kitchen so that she wouldn't drool all over the living room carpet.<br /><br />In addition, the replacement treats are a bit expensive considering the amount of time they take the dog to consume. In short, i gave this 4 stars because although your dog is virtually guaranteed to have a great time with it, it's not every day toy.",1.0

"My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various ""squeezie"" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to ""eat"" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home.",2.0

Like Olio Taibi's Biancolilla, this is really good - a wonderful flavor, full olive but with a hint of peppery spiciness. I would have rated this a '5' were it not for the price, which I consider high. Because of its somewhat unique flavor, and its cost, I never mix this for a vinaigrette (to me it would be like using a 15 year-old estate bottled rum for a rum & coke), but rather just use it with some freshly baked bread when enjoying a salad and some wine.

Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.",2.0

"I did a lot of research on this fondant and really wanted to like it however it just didn't work for me. When it arrived it was hard as a rock, but there is a card inside that indicates about 30-50 seconds in the microwave will make it easier to work with. This really did work well. It made it much more pliable and easier to work with. The fondant took color real well and rolled out nicely. It does say ""no shortening or powdered sugar needed"" that's pretty false. If you're coloring it you do need some while needing otherwise it will stick to your hands and your work surface. I DEFINITELY needed powdered sugar while rolling it out. Otherwise it stuck to the silicon mat I use. Also, after coloring and putting it in the microwave it definitely needed some time in the refrigerator before it could be rolled again and placed on the cake. Otherwise it was far too gooey.<br /><br />Finally, the moment of truth arrived, laying the rolled out fondant on the cake. It was much more difficult to work with than I imagined. It's very picky on the thickness. Too thick it's impossible to lay flat, too thin and it would stretch and get holes. I will say it did get some 'elephant skin' during application I was able to smooth it out using a smoothing tool and the final product looked fine. Perhaps I was a little bit rusty, I used to teach a Wilton cake decorating class and have taught fondant decorating for many years but haven't done a cake in the past 5-6 years. I just never remember the wilton brand, which tastes horrible, ever being this hard to work with.<br /><br />The flavor was fine on it's own, but as most fondants, it's incredibly sweet..incredibly. Despite the improved flavor people were still pealing it off the cake and eating the cake and frosting.<br /><br />In the end the cake looked wonderful and people were pleased but not sure I'll be using this brand again.",1.0
"I've tried at least six other varieties in the Maruchan Yakisoba product line. Maruchan Yakisoba Beef Taco flavor is far and away the spiciest of the ones I've tried. It's also the only one that consistently boils over when prepared according to the package instructions. There must be something in the dry ingredients packet that causes water to boil more quickly (the instructions -- a cup of water, dry ingredients pack, and four minutes, are basically the same on all varieties). Cutting the time down to three minutes and thirty seconds seems to eliminate the problem in my Panasonic microwave, but you'll just have to experiment to find what time works best in your own oven.<br /><br />I like these, but I definitely need to be in a mood for a spicy meal to enjoy them. I usually have frozen chopped onions and bell peppers in my freezer; sometimes I'll add about a quarter cup of them to the yakisoba pan before cooking, making for an even spicier dish.",1.0

"I'm restricted to gluten-free food products. I've tried other brands when this would disappear off the shelf in my local market. The others were worse than unappealing -- They smelled and tasted like paper mache' paste. So I took to ordering this by the case from my local health food store. I switched to Amazon's subscription to receive it because it costs less per box and I only have to get 4 at a time (I don't have to figure out where to keep 12 boxes).<br /><br />The subscription service is GREAT! You choose how often to receive delivery. When delivery time comes up, you have the option to delay it if you want, and there's no shipping charge. I now receive several items in this manner because it's less expensive and I don't have to worry about them not being on the store shelf when I need them.<br /><br />Case to case, the cereal can be a bit inconsistent, not in flavor but I find I may have to adjust the cooking time a little bit (a difference of seconds) to get the consistency in texture that I like.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY recommend this product and hope I never have need to smell paper mache' in my kitchen again!",1.0
"I'm going to buck the trend of reviews here.  I have eyed these at Whole Foods before.  We frequently make hummus and fried chick peas (yum!), and when I saw a good deal on a case, after reading all the great reviews, I thought I would give these a try.  I was particularly impressed to learn that the can was BPA free.<br /><br />Usually, I enjoy snacking on chickpeas right out of the can as we are preparing our recipes.  I popped one into my mouth, and was underwhelmed.  The second one, I thought maybe I just need to get used to them.  The third was as bland as the first two.  We ended up adding lots of seasoning to give these any flavor at all.<br />My husband teases me occasionally about using up the remaining cans.<br /><br />Maybe I am just not the target audience for this product.  Mine is strictly and clearly the opinion of someone who does not look for low sodium products. I am sure these are great for others (as indicated by other reviews), but I wanted to give the review of someone who does not regularly eat foods without any salt - I wish I had read one before I purchased these.  if you are not used to no-salt added products, like me, these may be to bland for you too.  As for me, I will save some coin and stick with the Goya brand (recommended by Cooks Illustrated),  when I have finally used up all of these.",0.0

"This is my second Super Automatic Espresso Maker. It's the lowest priced model available and is pretty good considering the price. The lack of extra features is not a problem. However there are some issues you might like to know before buying. Overall, it makes a decent espresso at the touch of a button. It's easy to clean and maintain and for that alone it's worth it since it saves you so much time.<br /><br />The quality of the espresso is decent - not bad, but not great either. It's far superior to drip coffee and easier than grinding your own beans. It took about a week to get the dosage and grinder settings to where I was satisfied. The defaults didn't use enough beans and the grind was too course which made the espresso quite bitter. You don't want run too much water through the grinds once the initial flavor is extracted.<br /><br />The temperature of the espresso is a little low. It's fine if you drink it right away or don't add cold milk. The only other little issue is the frother dispenses quite a bit of water before the actual steam. Therefore you have to use a second cup and run it for a few seconds until the steam flows consistently, then switch to your milk so you don't dilute it. Not a big deal but my last machine didn't require this step.<br /><br />Finally, the last issue has to do with the horrible packaging. The main box is contained in an outer box that's almost twice its size. The problem is there was NO PADDING whatsoever in the outer box, so the inner one is left to get slammed around throughout its entire shipping journey. My machine become separated along the main seam that runs all the way around the unit so it didn't even close properly until I pushed it back into place - there's still a small crack on one of the plastic pieces. Also, some of the buttons popped off. I would have returned it but it's kind of a hassle to ship something so large and it still works okay, so not a big deal, but wouldn't order one from here again.<br /><br />The bottom line is Super Automatic Espresso makers are an amazing convenience for those who appreciate fresh coffee. The quality is much better than the pod makers and far easier than grinding your own beans and making a whole pot at a time. The espresso isn't as good as a manual machine and this model doesn't have any fancy features, but still an amazing value for the price.",1.0

"I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.",1.0

I'm pretty picky about what my cats are fed.  While I have never eaten it myself - my clan of 4 all approve this flavor of Weruva.

As other reviewers have said, there aren't a lot of chocolate chips in them, so you could always add your own.<br /><br />The dough does feel differently, but when you start in gluten free baking, you have to get over the expectation that recipes will mix up the same as the ones with regular flour.

"To initially sum this review up: I am so glad I bought this food for my dog. This is an excellent quality dog food and is a great value. Not only does my dog absolutely love it, but it has had many noticeable benefits to his health.<br /><br />I have an 18 month old chocolate lab, and unlike every other Labrador Retriever, he does not eat anything and everything. He is very picky about his kibble. For months, I was buying every kind of dog food, and never found a single brand that he was excited to eat. Normally, he would sniff the food, walk away, and return minutes later only because he was starving. For the past month, I had settled on Beneful, because he seemed to enjoy it more than any other food. Granted, he obviously wasn't ecstatic about it, but he usually finished it all. However, I eventually realized that I had to focus more on what he enjoyed. First off, he has several problems with his stomach. His stomach growls constantly, he belches, and he's occasionally gassy. He also throws up often and worst of all, he has trouble using the bathroom. He often appeared either constipated or his stool was very soft. Very worried, I made an appointed for a vet visit. My veterinarian instructed me to stop feeding him supermarket dog foods because they were all, for the most part, of terrible quality and not helping my dog at all. He told me all about reading ingredient labels on dog food, what to look for and what to avoid and went on to say that if I wanted to help ease my dog's discomfort, my only option was to buy a high quality dog food. I was reluctant because I knew that along with high quality comes a high price- except in this case, that is.<br /><br />I searched Amazon and found Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul. A 35 pound bag was only $40, and I had been paying $16.99 for a 15 pound bag of that Beneful crap. So obviously the price was great. Furthermore, it appeared to be a high quality food--no bad fillers and REAL MEAT as the primary ingredients, and the reviews were all positive. So I bought it, and I will never buy anything else.<br /><br />The first day I fed my dog Chicken Soup, he practically inhaled it. He LOVED it, which lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. He is actually excited about eating kibble now, doesn't hesitate to eat, and can't get enough of Chicken Soup. But the best benefit: he is so much healthier. His stomach problems seemed to have ceased altogether. I have not seen him throw up once, and when he has to use the bathroom, he is not constipated, nor are his stools runny or soft. He is able to go effortlessly and best of all, he doesn't go as often. He is not gassy and I never hear his stomach rolling. Moreover, his coat looks shinier and his bark sounds healthier. And did I mention: NO MORE STOMACH PROBLEMS!<br /><br />I returned to my veterinarian, and though he had never heard of Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, I brought him the ingredients label and he said it appeared to be a kibble of great quality. But the best evidence I had to show him: my dog. He is a thousand times more healthy, and my vet (as well as myself) was so pleased to see the turnaround.",2.0

"Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats by Nature's Variety, 4-Ounce Package<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />They're oddly-shaped, greyish-beige, roughly circular pucks about the size of a modern dollar piece around and maybe half an inch thick, that look so thoroughly unappetizing that I immediately gave up all thought of trying a piece of one and reporting on the taste for the sake of art. One look at them from my all-too-human perspective and I had a whole new scale by which to determine how important my art as a reviewer really was to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I found the reactions of the three cats I gave these to a surprisingly mixed bag.<br /><br />One, the finnickiest eater that will do anything for a piece of Salisbury steak half the size of your pinky, ate one whole one (which I had to break into quarters) and lost interest halfway through the second one. The second one sniffed at a piece exactly once and walked away, while the skinny and freakish third one that never liked me (they're my roomate's cats, not mine) had a reaction that, translated into words, would have been this more or less:<br /><br />""Hmmm... I see you have that. What is that? interesting... aroma, yes, the word is aroma... intriguing... perhaps even enticing...<br /><br />Where did you get it? Give it to me. Give it to me now!<br /><br />Hmmm... Yeeeeees...<br /><br />You have more, don't you? Good. Give it to me! Give it to me now!<br /><br />[chewing] Yes.

A temporary hit. A great big hit and a definite miss on three housecats. They're somewhat expensive for pet-treats but, with the right cat, you could use them to try and teach the basics like, ""come when I say your name"" and ""hiss at someone else.""<br /><br />As far as dogs are concerned, this is going to have to wait until I can overcome the idea of how a stranger might react to my approaching him or her and saying, ""Hey, you don't know me.

"This coffee smells fabulous. Brew a cup and the whole house smells great. Vanilla and coffee together is a match made in heaven. Allow a small piece of dark chocolate to melt in your mouth with this coffee, and that is even better. I just didn't care for the Starbucks burnt bean flavor.<br /><br />If you love the Starbucks burnt roast flavor of their coffee, it is possible that you will love this coffee. The vanilla flavor is clearly present at exactly the right level, not so overbearing that the coffee tastes like vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this is not a shot of vanilla sugar syrup for your coffee. Nor is it a Mini-Moo French Vanilla cream addition. The flavor is one of coffee, pure very dark roasted Starbucks coffee, and vanilla, no sweetness or milk flavor.<br /><br />The package directions, 2 tablespoons of coffee per six ounce cup is extremely strong, especially if made in a French press. I love espresso, am addicted to Nespresso (three each morning), really strong coffee in France and Italy, and Turkish coffee without sugar. I drink all coffee black. So I am not afraid of a strong coffee. The problem for me, Starbucks burns their beans, and it imparts a flavor that I just don't enjoy. Clearly a bazillion people disagree with me. However, these directions made coffee that was just way too strong. It might be fine in a drip coffee maker, but certainly not a French Press with water at exactly 180 degrees.",1.0

"I love Bavarian cream, it's such a nice luscious flavor. Though a big part of the reason I like it is the texture--and surely, a matcha couldn't really capture that, right? Well once again Red Leaf proves that they cam turn ANY flavor into a matcha and make it work! This is creamy, dreamy, vanilla custard with of course a lovely hint of grassy green matcha in the background. But the feel is smooth, creamy, and luscious. It really is like Bavarian Cream in a cup! It's got that same smooth custard-like texture as their Cheesecake Matcha, but I think Bavarian Cream edges it out a bit in terms of my favorites. Highly recommended!",2.0

"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.",0.0

"I bought this ""flavor"" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.",0.0

This was a great cookie.  I was very happy with how soft it was.  Being in the individual wrapping made it easy to through in the diaper bag or purse.  My 18 month old son loved the cookie.  Would love to have these in the house at all times.  Such a healthier way to enjoy cookies.,2.0
"Like the most recent reviewer, my most recent purchase of these had a slash across the top of the bag--my slash didn't cover the width of the bag, more like two inches but it is easy to spot. This leads me to believe that when the people at Amazon Distribution Center(s) are opening the cases / boxes that contain the bags, they're not showing due diligence when working with sharp tools. Today our dog's treats, tomorrow someone's hand? PLEASE BE MORE CAREFUL AMAZON SHIPPING EMPLOYEES, I don't want you folks to cut yourselves or my dogs treat bags!<br /><br />Other than my complaint about the bag, the bones are well loved by my dogs and the slit in the bag has not reduced their desire to have their daily treat.<br /><br />I'm still awarding the product a five star rating since I suspect that it's not the bone' manufacturer that is responsible for the slit top bags.",2.0
"I've been making curries for decades, in the UK and here in the USA but can't be bothered with using individual spices, so I have always used commercially available curry powder.  I've always thought Sun Brand Madras Curry Powder was good - the closest I'd found in the USA to the better powders available in the UK but due to a mix-up on ordering and wanting to see if I could get a powder with a little more ""heat"" in it, I tried this Roland Hot Madras Curry Powder.<br /><br />It says it's a Product of India but to me this is NOT curry powder!  It doesn't look, smell or taste like curry - it's light brown greyish with a hint of green, doesn't have that characteristic aromatic scent of curry and it most resembles, in appearance and smell, what I once bought as Garam Masala (Rajah brand).  The overriding flavor in a cooked dish is of cloves and cinnamon.  Note that cinnamon is not listed in the ingredients but cassia is, though it's near the end of the list, as is cloves; possibly the ingredients are not listed in descending order of amount.  The other possibilities are that the main spices are of low quality or have gone stale - wouldn't be the first time, if anyone knows the Vencatachellum-Sharwoods saga, which, from what I gather, may have undergone a further, more recent degradation.  The containers are made of reinforced cardboard with a silvery inner lining and have a ring-pull aluminum seal top and bright steel bottom - no ""Best By"" date code so hard to tell if the product could have gone stale in storage.<br /><br />For those interested in salt content, it's listed fifth in the list of ingredients but there's no ""Nutrition Facts"" panel so no way to know estimated amount per serving.  There is no mustard, anise or ginger mentioned and interestingly, the recipe for a shrimp dish on the container mentions using fresh ginger.  The rest of the ingredients look about right for a ""curry powder"" so I'm left wondering why I'm disappointed and what to do with those 12 cans - maybe I can blend with something to make it palatable to me.  Meanwhile I'll be ordering some more Sun Brand and hoping quality hasn't deteriorated there.",0.0

"Quaker Instant Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal is a hearty dish for breakfast.  It's tasty, filling, and easy to prepare.  The ease of preparation is important for working folks who don't want to rush to work with an empty stomach.  Combined with a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice, the oatmeal will definitely hold and fortify you until lunch.<br /><br />It also makes for a good snack, instead of overly salty and sugar-rich foods.  I know many people put sugar and milk in their oatmeal, but I'm a purest.  I enjoy it just plain.  It's sweet enough to tingle one's taste buds, but not so sweet as to make it feel as if you're eating candy.  Instant foods suffer a generally bad reputation.  When ""ease of preparation"" is a primary consideration, often flavor suffers.  Not so here.  There was plenty of maple flavor.<br /><br />There are two options for preparing the instant oatmeal, one involving boiling water, the other tap water and the microwave.  I combined the two, because I like really hot oatmeal.  First I added boiling water, as directed, and let the oatmeal stand for a minute or so.  Then I gave it a 15-second nuke in the microwave.  The result was perfect for me.  If this sounds like too much preparation, stick with one of the prescribed methods, listed on the box.<br /><br />I'm not a really devoted oatmeal eater, so I may not be the ultimate authority on this product.  My review is based on the flavor (quite pleasant), preparation time (swift), and texture (just right, not too watery, not lumpy).  As with any food, individual taste is a major factor.",1.0

My husband and I live in Argentina and were using a Costco brand whole bean coffee that was quite delicious, especially for the price. When we ran out I searched Amazon for an inexpensive highly rated coffee.<br />Well overall, my husband and I find this hard to drink. My husband isn't usually as picky as I am but even he finds this hard to swallow. The coffee is bitter, extremely acidic and the awful flavor lingers on your tongue after every sip. I feel like I'm drinking the remnants of week-old 7-11 coffee. Even when putting a creamer into it, it is still difficult to taste anything but off-putting sludge.

"If these had not been organic I'd only given 2 stars. I'm used to eating Nature's Path organic ginger spice cookies which is the one I'm using to compare. The NP ones have a stronger ginger flavor which I prefer. The crunch factor (hardness) is about the same. The price point is the biggest factor. The NP at $32 w/o coupon for 12 9 ox. boxes are approx.4.75 pound (the last case I bought had a coupon so were $22 or 3.26/lb). These are about 6.50/lb. at Amazon's current price.

"I live near Seattle and have drunk ""Pike's Place Roast"" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right.",1.0

"Where, oh where can you find a tea strainer that doesn't leak?  These Tuffy Steepers are cute, look practical and easy to use, but they fail at their basic purpose...straining the tea and keeping leafs out of the brew.  They collapse into easily transportable shapes, come with a little lid that serves as a base for the hot, wet strainer when finished, they're dishwasher safe...but they don't keep the loose tea out of the brew!  Infuriating.  Plus, they're awful big and take up a lot of room in the cup, so when you remove the steeper, you're left with a 1/2 cup of tea.  One other thing, there's a funky clip that you can see in the pictures.  It's a small plastic thing that extends out over the steeper, for what purpose I can't tell.  It might have been better designed where it repositioned to extend out and down, so you could clip it over the rim of the cup to steady the thing.  I was disappointed by these.  Great looks, little function.  My hunt continues.",0.0

"I just cannot understand why this company chooses to add sugar to a fruit that they claim is tree-ripened.  I am truly baffled.  The added sugar leaves a crystalline sweetness that is not mango-flavored to the fruit and renders it a ridiculous replacement for mango.  It ends up being too sweet.<br /><br />Why buy dried mango?  If you cannot get fresh mango, it is the next best thing.  Canned mango, because the canning procedure demands heating the food above boiling point, dismantles all enzymes and antioxidants, but the drying process does not.  There are 3 fruits that are particularly valuable for the enzymes found in them: kiwi, pineapple, and mango.  These enzymes are not made by our bodies but are particularly helpful for the fast transport of calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphate, and manganese into cells whose membranes have been damaged (e.g. by circulating toxins, poisons, both of which we are always bombarded with, even if we do not recognize the symptoms).  These ions, and thus the fruit enzymes, are critical for repair of those cells.  Since bacterial infections leave poisons behind, good dried mango is especially helpful for fast recovery from infections.<br /><br />The best mango is thoroughly dried, making it quite brittle.  If you want to snack on it or make mango ice cream, you reconstitute it by adding just enough water to cover a few slices (in warm weather it will take about an hour to reconstitute 1/2 cup).  Keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose.  They last in that form there for at least a week, unless you live where there is an enormous amount of wet weather and thus a lot of mold.  Prevent mold survival in the refrigerator by keeping there a small plastic container with holes punched in the top half full of vinegar. Your fruits and veges will last a lot longer.<br /><br />However the best way to eat it is to add chopped mango to your entree or salad.  Thus this stuff this company is selling is just too weak in flavor, but the sugar will come off in the liquid found in the meal.",0.0
"My two finicky dogs just love, love this snack! They don't just eat any snack that comes their way, in fact, they usually turn their noses up when I try to give them other pretty darn good natural dog snacks, but this one is a winner!

The 16 oz bag lasts us for about two months (two dogs), which is pretty darn good considering the price.

"This is not a sausage, this is paste in a plastic tube which is shaped like a sausage. Then you cut the tube off and you're left with a log of mash.

"Adopting a Miniature Schnauzer after the loss of my Standard Schnauzer last month, I felt the pressure of having to house break a puppy once again. The previous owner allowed him to remain in his crate too long each day, so I geared up for the battle. I used chicken strips to train the Standard; however, my Miniature nearly jumped out of the shopping cart when a Petco dog trainer gave him a sample of this treat. It took me nearly three months to house break my Standard compared to less than two weeks for my Miniature. He receives this treat when he urinates outside and another (expensive) treat for his poop in order to understand the difference between the two in addition to preventing him from ""eating the same ol' cracker for both actions"". I have never witnessed a dog go wild over a treat until now, and I am willing to invest in such product as long as we both experience an award in the end.<br /><br />After reading customer reviews for this product, I am glad to know there is a common factor of bad gas and runny poop for several owners. I can only speak for myself; however, I reduced both the portion size and amount I feed him daily along with feeding him hard dog food instead of half (soft) and half (hard). My best guess is that it takes a minute for the dog's system to accept this treat, because my dog's poop has returned to being hard. The gas is not a pleasant smell; however, we all have gas so I have learned to live with it. Such sacrifice is worth the money considering his positive attitude to rush outside to squat long enough to get what he wants. I can show you multiple urine areas in my carpet my Standard was guilty for during his training; however, I can hold up three fingers to represent the number of incidents my Miniature has committed to date.<br /><br />This particular puppy treat is worth the money. If you want to preserve your carpet, reduce moneys for carpet cleaning solutions, etc., this treat is your BEST solution by far.",2.0

While using these packets couldn't be simpler, they are just a smidge too wide for easy access to the preheated popping bucket.

"I eat this almost everyday for breakfast because of it's convenience and nutritional value. A word of waring. It is hard on the teeth if you don't ""crunch"" gently. Many days I just poor it in plastic cup (dry) and eat it on the way to work with a mug of joe. It tastes healthy and sweet.",1.0
"So my male cat developed a urinary/bladder problem.  Long story short(and 2 grand later)the vet said he should be on Hill's Prescription Diet C/D canned food.  We started him on that, but each can was substantially more expensive than other canned foods.  That's when, thanks to looking around on various sites, others have said they used Friskies Special Diet.  Cat enjoys the taste, and it always gets mixed with a few ounces of water to increase his water intake (cat does not drink water at all from his water dish).<br /><br />Using Subscribe and Save (discounted price and auto monthly shipments) along with Prime membership (free shipping), the price beats going to the store so it's a no brainer.<br /><br />This is working for my cats health, but I am not a vet nor should you blindly follow this review if your looking for an alternative to Hill's or other Prescription canned foods.",2.0

"I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn't really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn't ship well.  It was sealed in a plastic bag (taped shut) and wrapped tightly in a cardboard mailer similar to the mailers for a paperback book.  The result was a disaster.  I could smell the fragrance when I opened my mailbox.  It smelled awesome, but that's not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.<br /><br />When I opened the package, it was a big yucky bag of goo.  A lot of the product had seeped out into the plastic bag.  I washed it off, but the lid and cap had also been damaged, so it leeks if I just squeeze the bottle.  That's a shame, because the bottle is designed to rest upside down (which is normally a nice feature for a product like this--it helps get the most product out of the bottle).<br /><br />So what about the product itself?  It smells good.  It's a clean fragrance that's fine for me or my wife.  As expected for a conditioner, it helps reduce tangles and keeps my scalp from drying out.<br /><br />I like this conditioner, but I'm not convinced that it's the best online purchase.",1.0
"I bought this syrup because my partner loves everything pumpkin. I thought I'd try it out to make pumpkin lattes and potentially use it to flavor other things.<br /><br />However, when tasted it, I was overwhelmed by cinnamon. I like cinnamon, but I felt the ""spice"" completely overpowered the pumpkin.<br /><br />Just in case the flavor would mellow when combined with food I tried it in a latte. The cinnamon still predominated and my drink had such a strong aftertaste I actually couldn't finish it. To be fair, I often find pre-flavored coffees to have an undesirable aftertaste as well, but I've had good luck with various syrups and additives... for instance, I can't stand Irish Creme flavored coffee, but I quite enjoy the occasional coffee with an actual shot of Irish Creme.<br /><br />I'm not saying the syrup is of bad quality, it's just that I feel it's important to let folks know exactly what they're in for.<br /><br />SUMMARY: I can't really taste the pumpkin over all the spice... very strong presence of cinnamon.",0.0

"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",1.0

"What can you say about a body wash? Does it get you clean? Yes. Well isn't that enough?<br /><br />Apparently not because this one has MICROMOISTURE technology. All these jargon words really make me laugh. You know there is a room of marketing guru's just sitting around thinking, ""what words can we put together that will make our product sound revolutionary?""<br /><br />This team came up with: patent filed technology (yes that's right, ""filed""), micromoisture technology, clinically proven, dermatologist recommended, and total skin comfort. I'm sure one of these is a typo on the container.<br /><br />But let's talk about the product now.<br /><br />Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.<br /><br />Texture - it has ""purifying grains"", which means it's sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says ""body and face"" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you're scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.<br /><br />So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it's been cleaned very well.<br /><br />So what don't I like? It's not a shampoo & body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won't apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don't recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.<br /><br />As advertised the product gets 4 stars. Improvement idea would be to make an all-in-one product so I don't have to spend longer in the shower or use two products to get clean.",1.0

Although one tiny bar contains only 100 calories, it's mostly carbohydrates that will spike your blood sugar and insulin levels. That's not very good for your body if you're attempting to eat healthy.

"I am a big fan of natural foods and eco-responsible packaging which is what drew me to this product.  The company has done a great job with its efforts towards sustainability in packaging but based on the cracker itself, I wondered if they had used the same materials for what was inside the box as well.  The crackers were dry, crumbly, shed the oat flakes readily and lacked much in the way of flavor.  If you are looking for a vehicle for peanut butter or some other food item, this is a fine product  but it really adds little else to the eating experience.  The crackers are scored but due to inadequate depth or their hard consistency, breaking them evenly is not possible.  If you must have graham crackers without high fructose corn syrup, this would be a perfectly acceptable product but I would sooner eliminate them from my diet than purchase these.",1.0

"Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa.<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea.  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, ""nutrition"" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of ""yummy."").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to ""gourmet it"" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As ""rice"" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with ""noodle heaven""; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As ""oatmeal"" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than ""outside-the-waves"" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food.  For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (½) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate ""lid""; zap it for another minute or half, then let it ""steep"" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate ""lid"" I can just place it on the table for family style ""digging in.""<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them.  And now Berry Farms has been added to my list of healthful, gourmet goods.<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the ""naked"" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of ""health""?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had ""lived"" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O"">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon",2.0

"Xylitol is fantastic for dental health.<br /><br />This gum is great because it doesn't contain any of the less-than-ideal additives (like aspartame-nutrasweet, saccharin, sorbitol, mannitol, artificial flavors, artificial colors, etc.) that make most other gums and mints, even those with xylitol as an ingredient, problematic.<br /><br />The flavor is nice, the texture is fine, and it lasts for at least 15 minutes (which is all I want it to do).<br /><br />Note that this gum is manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it's non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other brands of xylitol products, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.<br /><br />I wish that this gum could be purchased in smaller amounts, because the price for this company's giant containers/packs is quite a lot of money to spend on something you've never tried before.  I'm sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in one 30-piece, portable little cardboard box, and sold it as an ""add-on"" product at Amazon for 2 dollars or something, just so folks could try it out.",2.0
"My wife and I have been drinking Dandy Blend for years.  So long in fact that we used to have to order it directly from Dandy Blend and pay $10 for standard UPS Ground shipping, because you couldn't find it anywhere else!  It's so nice to be able to buy it on Amazon, and with Prime shipping!<br /><br />We still drink Starbucks coffee in the morning, using the french press that I bought at one of their stores, but we just can't handle the caffeine or acidity of coffee after dinner, so we use Dandy Blend in the evenings and for making iced coffee and desserts.<br /><br />Dandy Blend:<br /><br />Tastes like coffee but has no caffeine<br />Has no acidity or bitterness<br />Is naturally sweetened with its own built-In fructose (no sugar or fructose added)<br />Contains all the goodness of dandelions<br />Is delicious iced<br />Dissolves instantly in hot or cold water<br />Can be used in any recipe which calls for instant coffee<br /><br />It has a slight taste of chicory that coffee does not have, but when mixed with half and half, flavored creamers, or Baileys ;-) you cannot tell that it is not coffee.  And from the health perspective, Dandy Blend is made from just 5 ingredients: the totally water-soluble extracts of roasted dandelion, chicory and sugar beet roots, and two roasted grains - barley and rye.<br /><br />Using 2 tablespoons of Dandy Blend per cup, this 2 pound back lasts us about a year, and we can feel good about giving our kids a cup when they get jealous over seeing us drinking coffee.",2.0

"By the time I was done reading so many colorful reviews for this product, I purchased it out of curiosity. I like to be as honest as I can in my review of a product. I found that much of what reviewers had to say was indeed true. This is a very steep price to pay for the amount and selection of candy included. I did my best to consider every aspect, but still it came up lacking. Any time we can get a variety to choose from in one package, it is fun. Like a grab bag type of thing. But if the majority of the things in the grab bag are cheap, it takes away from it.<br />  It makes me think about shopping for music c.d.'s with a variety of different artist on it. Yes, the idea is nice, but if the majority of the songs don't sound good, I would much rather skip it!!!",0.0
"After a lot of trial and error I have decided that Stevia is the best substitute sugar product for me.

"First off, I have found that buying these treats on Amazon is cheaper than purchasing them at PetSmart. I buy the capsule version of the Pill Pockets versus the tablet version because the bags are larger (it holds more ounces) and the cost difference is almost nothing. I then break that one capsule up into many pieces because they are soft & malleable. I am able to get that one bag to last me for many servings. I only use it to wrap up my dog's Prozac pill.  He will gobble it down with no problem. However, if I try to use any larger pill such as a Heartworm pill or Allergy pill in them, he will eat the treat part off & spit out the medicinal pill. For those types of pills, I just crush them up and stir them in some wet food for him.",2.0

"This is a one pound of dried Goji berries that are smaller than I am used to. It is also drier than other Gojis I tried. That could be an advantage since the product is sold by weight, you do get more product than if it was moist.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted moldy gojis in their bag and I did notice my bag having the same issues. I just picked them off.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted that in Chinatown you could get goji berries cheaper. I have gotten them in Chinatown and I noticed they came with warning that it has to be rinsed and cooked. I guess it would be good to be used in cereals or in homemade granola where you can use wet cooked gojis. In this day of instant gratification, I do not see myself reaching out and snacking on the Chinatown version of goji that I have to rinse it.<br /><br />Will I continue to get this Navitas product from Amazon ? Yes as it has been certified to be Organic and Kosher (meaning clean). The price is decent. So I can snack on them and get the nutritional benefits. Goji is said to have one of the highest concentration of Zeaxanthin, an antioxidant important for vision and it is being studied for prevention of Macular Degeneration. Note that Goji juice does not have a measurable amount of Zeaxanthin. You have to get it from dried fruit.<br /><br />I bought a container of Goji berries in a reputable Chinese Medicine Pharmacy in Beijing and that was like the best Goji berries I had. It was larger in size and they were evenly the same size. I paid nine dollars for the half pound container. I find that getting a regular shipment from Amazon to be a  tad more convenient than going to Beijing to get Goji berries.<br /><br />4-15-11 Addendum.<br /><br />I got my second bag of this product and it was a much greater improvement over the first bag I received. The berries were actually larger (just like the ones I got in Beijing!) and it was more moister. And it actually tasted sweeter. Looks like they may have gotten a different supplier and this bring closer to the premium grade. One colleague of mine who is the head of Nutrition Society for Optometrists tells me that a store in Pasadena, California sells Goji berries that are moist like raisins. I have not seen those but sounds good and sounds expensive! Anyhow, the second bag of this specific product shows a much greater improvement and I am very happy!",1.0
"I am trying to find a great chai to make at home when I am not treating myself to a Starbuck's chai. I was drinking Pacific Chai (spicy) for a long time which I liked for the most part. (I made it into a vanilla chai by adding a 1/2 tsp of French Vanilla coffee-mate creamer to about a 10-oz cup of water, with 3 tbs of chai powder, while in the blender.) After a year or so, I wanted to try something different because the Pacific Chai containers were always 3/4 full - it became annoying. But it turns out that some other brands are the same.<br /> I love vanilla chai but I didn't prefer the Pacific vanilla chai because it wasn't spicy enough, and the same thing goes for Big Train Chai Vanilla - not spicy enough. Also, Mocafe Vanilla Chai is too weak.<br /> I tried to convert Big Train Spiced Chai into vanilla chai by adding several drops of vanilla extract and some cinnamon but I just did not like it with or without these extras.<br /> I would love to find the perfect vanilla chai that has great spicy flavor.<br /><br />(I always make my chai in the blender using about 10-oz of water only and 3tbs of chai powder.

They are a superior cracker to a lot of others out there and are a huge hit with my 1 year old.  She is able to hold the cracker easily and take bites safely.

"I normally eat cookies from bakeries, rather than supermarket cookies, as  provided by my workplace at lunches and events, so I'm comparing them with what I'm familiar with, not against other industrially produced cookies.<br /><br />These are very sweet, without much real chocolate flavor.  While the gooey chocolate filling is much better than just the dry little chips, it needed to have more flavor. The texture of the cookie itself was what really lost me.

"Best chocolate cereal ever made IMHO. Krave tastes sort of like Oreos combined with Fudge Pop-Tarts. It's weird because they aren't frosted really, but somehow the insides impart a sense of being frosted. More chocolate-y than Cocoa Pebbles or Count Chocula. Although they are in the shape of squares, they aren't as hard or rocky as Cap'n Crunch and Krave doesn't get soggy very quickly. Unlike Cocoa Krispies, the chocolate doesn't diffuse into the milk very quickly. With Cocoa Krispies, you very quickly get regular soggy Rice Krispies in chocolate milk. This cereal stays more as chocolate cereal and the milk as regular milk. And it doesn't give you as much of a ""chemical-buzz"" as a lot of presweetened cereal does.<br /><br />I am not even going to try and make it anything about nutrition. People buy sweet cereals for the taste, and for their kids. Having tasted all the chocolate cereals out there since I was a little kid, my opinion is that this is the best chocolate cereal currently being made. Watch out if you like chocolate, because I think kids and parents who like chocolate might battle over this stuff. It could become addictive.",2.0

"You know those quart milk cartons?  That's what this is; a LOT of salt, enough to last thru literally hundreds of pounds of popcorn.  Well worth the few bucks, so don't overthink it.  More than enough salt to share with friends or family if you don't want to keep it around for years, as you will likely not use it all before the date printed on the package.<br /><br />I'm using coconut oil and Flavacol as many posters have suggested.  This combo makes GREAT popcorn!  On the stovetop, I'm heating the oil, adding the Flavorcol, then the kernels. It's popping up fluffy and yellow.  Great smell and great taste.  Then I bought a West Bend Stir Crazy, adding the salt to the oil as some reviewiers suggested.  Absolutely love the convenience of the Stir Crazy over the stovestop, but too much salt remains on the popper, so I just shake it on immediately after popping, while still hot.<br /><br />Right now, I'm not using fancy or gourmet popcorn, just the regular store stuff.  It is still great.<br /><br />Couple of tips:<br /><br />1) The package lists recommended amount of product for the amount of popcorn you're making.  Remember, this product is basically salt with artificial flavor and color added, so preferences will vary. Start with the recommended amount on the package and experiment. Just remember, you can always add more if not salty enough, but your batch is ruined if you use too much.<br /><br />2) I use a dredge (shaker) for easier dispensing.  The carton is not convenient for regular usage.<br /><br />So if you're a popcorn lover and want to take your popcorn to the next level, this is a good start.",1.0

"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.",0.0

So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle.",0.0

"It's hard to add to much to a review here other than to join in the choir.  I picked this up because my wife loves trying new hair products, and I always try them with here.  I didn't know anything about this other than the name ""Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm"" which sounded pretty simple and universal.  Like everyone, when I got it I wasted time scouring the package for directions (Surprise! There are none!) and then just gave it a shot.<br /><br />After reading several of the reviews here, it looks like this is a race-specific product, of which the packaging gives no clue.  Maybe there are some secret code words I am missing, but I have ""natural hair"" as in the hair on my head is natural.<br /><br />We have two kinds of ""natural hair"" in my household, and this didn't work for either of them.  My wife (Asian; long hair) gave up after one try and said it was way to greasy.  Me (White guy; short hair) was a little more persistent.  I tried it on dry hair and wet hair and moist hair, but to no avail.  It works pretty good as a hair gel, and is powerful enough to stick my hair straight up. I could have used it during my punk rock days to stand up my Mohawk, but then there is the overpowering scent to go with it. I don't think it will replace my standard hair gel anytime soon.<br /><br />It seems like this is more of a marketing fail than a product fail. It has a pretty specific market and use, and is not as general as the name and packaging would lead you to believe.",0.0
"Not only is this Chili the most delicious canned chili I've ever had (speaking of the Campbell's Chunky brand in general), it's perfect for use in various quick and easy ""recipes"" since heating it up takes just moments versus the time involved in making homemade chili from scratch.  The Roadhouse isn't ""hot"" spicy, but it is very hearty and has a zing due to the great spices included.  If you add a little extra chili powder, you can adjust the flavor a bit (again) without the hassle of making chili from scratch when you only have a few minutes to begin with.",2.0

"I have a 35-pound 6-month old Keeshond, who I would classify as a ""moderate"" chewer. I bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of ""give,"" and the Durachew Nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods. Indeed, after some insecurity about this bone, my Keeshond took to it just fine. She seemed to enjoy lying on the floor, munching away on it for several minutes at a time. After the first session, I saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray, but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice, which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog's digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life-threatening obstructions.<br /><br />However, after only a couple more chewing sessions, I noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone. Luckily for both of us, I never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone. Earlier today, during one of her play sessions with the bone, I looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor, with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something. The thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and I quickly swooped in to pick it up: It was a piece of the bone, substantially larger than a ""grain of rice""--about an inch long by half an inch wide. Though I cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction, I did not want to take any chances. The packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off, and I did just that.<br /><br />Look. My dog is not a Pit Bull. She is a Keeshond. Keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers. And, although I will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things, she is not more of a chewer than an average dog, and there is no world in which she can be considered a ""powerful"" chewer. This bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing? It should have stood up to more punishment. I only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it. Otherwise, I consider this bone a safety hazard.<br /><br />If you do choose to buy this bone, make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off. The instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company's liability, but they are right.",0.0

"I really love these hunts diced tomatoes with green peppers, celery and onion.

I've read news reports that the prices of tomatoes will be going up from 15% to 20% in the coming months because of inflation and supply shortages so I want to make sure to have a nice supply.<br /><br />  I've had other brands of diced tomatoes and they are usually overly filled with juice or contain harmful ingredients like ""high fructose corn syrup"" Hunts quality can't be beat,these cans are filled with tasty healthy tomatoes with very small amounts of liquid to drain.

"A few years back, prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor, I switched my dogs to foods without corn.  I was convinced, right or wrong, that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections.  I believe, again right or wrong, that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn...which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food!  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand...I found this food by accident.  The only type the store had was the weight loss formula.  Turns out my dogs love it!

"Over the years I've randomly picked up various sea salts hoping to find that perfect salt crystal that almost looks like it formed into tiny little delicate flakes. After running through quite a few, salt shakers, salt grinders, natural sea salts, salts harvested by natives who have been doing it for hundreds of years, you name it! They all seem to come up the same for me, the texture is never right. Even salt grinders can't get that perfect texture. So to make a long story short, I picked a shaker of this stuff up in the health food store one day and haven't looked back since. I've found my perfect salt! The texture is flawless; flakey and just slightly clumpy without over doing it. About the only thing I can say that's negative is the shaker dispensers tend to clump at the top and it takes an occasional reverse tap to clear the holes. Not a big deal though.<br /><br />I do wish you could buy one bag of this stuff instead of 6! The salt shakers are 7.5 ounces and last me forever. These bags are 35.3 ounces and there's 6 of them!

"I LOVE cooking with new flavors, and pride myself on being an adventurous cook.  I don't do beef much (a few times a year), but happened to have some primo beef that was perfect for this.<br /><br />I seared my beef in a cast iron skillet on all sides, then cooked partway through.<br /><br />I mixed the coconut powder, water, and oil in a Pyrex measuring cup, and added it to the pan, then added the paste.  It blended together perfectly!  No lumps or issues.  *BUT, I am not a fan of the dehydrated vegetable pieces--those were a distraction and we picked them out in the end.*<br /><br />I cooked the meat through with the lid on, at a med-low heat, stirring every few minutes, and turning the beef.<br /><br />To go with it, I made a mixture of different colors of quinoa and a side of lightly sauteed asparagus with garlic.<br /><br />The beef took on the color of the sauce (all the way through the meat).  I found this interesting.<br /><br />The flavor, I thought, was VERY good, especially with the quinoa.  I actually could have just eaten it with the vegetables and quinoa, and opted out of the beef altogether.  My guest, on the other hand, found it spicy (hot-spicy) and although he liked the flavor of the dish, said he would not order it for himself due to how his particular tastebuds perceived that hot-ness.  My mother and her husband would have found it altogether inedible, because they cannot handle any ""spice"" in their foods.  Just an FYI, in case you have sensitive people to feed.<br /><br />It made a LOT of food.  We two adults ate about 1/3 of the dish.<br /><br />I personally would order this for me, but since he can't enjoy it, it puts a damper on my recommendation.

These are just the thing to help get over those darn inevitable delays.<br /><br />This is the first time I've had freeze dried fruit in a bag. It's a bit of a surprise the first time you open the bag. The strawberry and banana smell is intense and fresh. Each piece of fruit is big. The strawberries have a clean natural strawberry flavor.

"I drink my coffee strong.

So I am comparing Puroast Low Acid Coffee to Folgers, and the Puroast Low Acid Coffee failed miserably.  I found Puroast coffee thin and weak with some bitterness.  There is a mild espresso flavor that is similar to Turkish coffee I have had.  Bitter and unpleasant, but weak at the same time.<br /><br />I have had acid reflux (GERD) in the past and drinking regular coffee does exacerbate the condition.  This low acid coffee is made for people with acid reflux conditions so severe that they have had to stop drinking their morning coffee, and I applaud the fact that any coffee company has addressed the issue.  At the same time, the price is prohibitive.  10 tiny 3 ounce bags for $24?  If you make one pot every morning, that $72 a month!  For that cost, I would suggest buying acid reducer pills, and taking one before you drink your morning coffee, and to try to eat something bland while drinking your coffee, to give your stomach something to do with all the acid it is creating.<br /><br />Or, if you only have acid reflux in the morning and you think it's the coffee you are drinking, be aware that it could be caused by some medications you are taking, like calcium or vitamin pills.  In fact, any large pill can sit in your stomach and cause your stomach to create a lot of acid trying to break it down.  A recommendation is to either take more frequent smaller doses of the vitamin supplement, or stop them all together and cut out the acid reflux entirely.  Or add acid reducer medication and put up with it.<br /><br />Two or three sips of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and it's down the drain.  It's giving me acid reflux just talking about it.",1.0

"ily issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink was good, but the can size was a bit small.  It is hardly more than 1 cup and at nearly $2 each, I'm not sure it is worth it.  A bottled coffee drink by a national brand is nearly the same cost per ounce, but comes in a bottle and contains an ounce more.  I also expected a more robust flavor. The flavor is very similar to that which you would get from a high quality drip coffee that you could make at home.  Just add cocoa and chill and the flavor would be about the same.<br /><br />The good thing about the can size is that it fits very easily into a purse or backpack, the can is recyclable and there is no worry about breakage like with a bottled coffee.",1.0
I did a search for Folgers K Cups and this product showed up.  I thought I was getting K Cups and I ordered both regular and decaf.

"After FINALLY purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Maker have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a mediunm cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!",2.0

I have found that other vets experience the same thing when they research the diets their patients are on.  That said, if your pet doesn't have any allergies to this you may be all right.  I have found that some patients get addicted to it, probably due to the processed oils and sugar that is included in the ingredient list.

"I bought these because it seemed a compelling way to get plant stanols, which medical literature praise for their cholesterol reducing abilities.  I don't consume a lot of bread, so the benecol/stanol butter substitute spreads were not a reliable source of stanols for me.<br /><br />However, these chews aren't all they are cracked up to be.  If you have 4 chews per day (like they suggest), you get 16 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar, and 80 calories!  For anyone who has high cholesterol + high triglycerides, that isn't a desirable way to get your stanols.  Even if these lower your cholesterol, the offsetting risk to your triglycerides might negate the heart healthy benefits.  I'm no expert on this, but I find that eating too many sugars only makes me hungrier.<br /><br />If you like to have spreads on your breads and are using stanols as part of your heart health regimen, I'd suggest a tub of Benecol or Smart Balance instead!<br /><br />Benecol - can you bring me stanols in a capsule without the sugar?",0.0

"They claim this product is all natural and made from monk fruit.  But monk fruit is not the only ingredient in Nectresse, nor is it even the primary ingredient. The first and most abundant ingredient in Nectresse is actually ERYTHRITOL, a sugar alcohol commonly derived from corn, the vast majority of which has been genetically modified (GM) in the U.S.  As some others here have attested, sugar alcohols give some people cramps or other digestive issues.<br /><br />The second ingredient in Nectresse is REFINED SUGAR, which more than likely comes from GM sugar beets.<br /><br />The third ingredient in Nectresse is monk fruit, which they claim is extracted using a natural process involving both water and heat rather than chemicals -- this is good.<br /><br />But the fourth and final ingredient in Nectresse is MOLASSES which, once again, is a sugar more than likely derived from GM sugar beets.  (Producers that use sugar from sugar cane, after all, typically indicate this on their ingredient labels!)<br /><br />So three out of the four ingredients used in Nectresse appear to be derived from bioengineered crops, and two of these ingredients are refined sugars! And since erythritol is a sugar alcohol, as well as the most abundant ingredient in Nectresse, they can legally claim under F.D.A. guidelines that it has zero calories per serving.<br /><br />But the fact that Nectresse more than likely contains ingredients derived from GM sources means that it is hardly the ""natural"" product that they're hyping it up to be. Sure, Nectresse contains a little bit of monk fruit which, like the stevia plant, contains compounds that are naturally very sweet, but that do not provide the body with calories in the same way as sugar. But the other ingredients found in Nectresse can hardly be considered natural.",0.0

Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a ""chewer."" Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball.

"Have you ever served up a can of Pedigree wet dog food for your furry little friend and felt secretly jealous as you watch him tear into the vaccuum packed ration like a lion tackling a zebra? If only it were possible for humans to survive on such simple yet delicious means.  If only there existed small, convenient meals of comparable taste and price made just for us folks at the top of the food chain.  Well, if you're still pondering a suitable solution then look no further than Hormel Compleats.  The beef steak tips with mashed potatoes in particular are sure to delight even the most sophisticated palette. In this meal we find overwhelmingly grainy mashed potatoes paired up with bland steak cutlets swimming in an even blander sauce that I can only assume to be some kind of gravy. With this kind of savory goodness you honestly can't go wrong at this price range. To top it all off, the meat appears to be 100% free of any type of seasoning or flavor enhancement in general, so don't hesitate to pile on some of your own sauces and spices to improvise. Not since the US Army's MREs (Meals Rejected by Ethiopians) have we seen such sublime culinary innovation.  In other words, it's the best of the best! Pick some up tonight for the whole family and keep the Pepto ready my friends, because believe me when I say this is one meal that just won't stay down on its own!",0.0

"From crazzeto's wife:<br />My baby developed a milk intolerance and very bad acid reflux around 2 months so we had to switch from breastmilk to Nutramigen and she HATED it. We had to flavor every bottle with expensive vanilla powder just to get her to drink it, and she still had a lot of pain and feeding difficulties. It's also three or four times more expensive than other types of formula, and honestly I think it is mostly because the company knows that if your baby needs it this is your only option and will have to pay whatever price they give you. We ended up switching to Similac Sensitive after a while and although she had more reactions to it, at least she would actually drink it and gain weight (unlike with this stuff) and it was cheaper too.",1.0

"I used to buy from Schwan's, but I no longer like what I used to get. Trying these very inexpensive meals was just for future selection purposes. But I decided to stick with these for a while. Had Swedish Meatballs - nope. Salsbury Steak - not so very. But this, actually good.<br /><br />I microwave it for 2 minutes, after lifting up the plastic from both sides to a point in the middle. For the taste to really develop, it must be blistering hot. Then I add some sage <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WR4LLU"">Simply Organic Organic Ground Sage ( 1x1.80 OZ)</a> and Habanero powder <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHXIGO"">Habanero Powder, Pure - 16 Oz Jar Each</a> on top.

"Before I get into the meat and potatoes of my review, I'd like to point out that the front of the packet reads, ""Sweet & Salty.""  THERE IS NO SALT IN THIS PRODUCT.  The ingredients listed are:  Popping corn, coconut oil, sugar, beta carotene.<br /><br />Now, if you make this in your Whirley Pop according to the directions on the back of the packet, the sugar caramelizes.  Not only does the sugar caramelize, but the crank is VERY hard to turn once the sugar starts melting; this makes it very easy, indeed, to break the delicate, plastic crank on your lid.  What you ultimately end-up with is sticky, brown popcorn, and a BIG mess to clean out of your pot and off of the lid (and cleaning that lid isn't exactly what I'd call ""easy"").  My daughter, the Princess of Kettle Corn wrinkled her nose when she saw what it looked like, but being the trooper that she is, she ventured a taste...and (drum-roll, please) she declared, ""Nope.  That DOES NOT taste like kettle corn!""<br /><br />So, after tossing the whole first batch and soaking the pot for an hour to get some kernels ""unglued,"" I tried again.  I opened the side of the packet that contains the popcorn and sugar FIRST (being careful not to open the oil side) and emptied the contents into a wire mesh strainer over a bowl.  I shook the strainer so that ALL of the sugar was separated from the popcorn kernels.  I reserved the sugar and mixed a little popcorn salt with it.  THEN, I opened the oil side and put that into the Whirley Popper along with the (now sugar-free) popcorn kernels.  I popped the popcorn as I usually would.  When it was finished, and still VERY hot, I took a large bowl with a tight-fitting lid and filled the bottom with hot popcorn; I sprinkled the sugar/salt mixture over this.  Then I added more popcorn; then more sugar/salt, repeating the process until the bowl was filled to within two inches of the top.  Then I put the lid on the bowl, and tossed and turned and shook until I was fairly certain that the popcorn was adequately covered with the sugar/salt mixture.  My daughter tasted it and liked it much better.<br /><br />My family LOVES our Whirley Popper and Wabash Valley Farms popcorn, but this product (in my opinion) is a dud, and an expensive one at that.  If you want my advice, use the Real Theater Popcorn packet and sprinkle some extra-fine sugar on it in the bowl (not the popper) while it's still hot -- you won't have to clean burned sugar out of the pot (and gunk off of the lid), you'll save money and you'll have fresh, non-microwaved kettle corn.",0.0

Most people try to choose a coffee with a lot of complimentary flavors to pair with a dessert but many desserts are so sweet and complex on their own that they just need a solid smooth coffee to let them shine, this roast is spot-on for that.

"Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say ""WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!"".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.",1.0
"These are crisp cookies with berries sprinkled through the cookie.  Not like the Newtons Fruit Crisps, or regular Newtons, which have a layer of fruit pur&eacute;e.  The cookie is 2.5 inches wide and about an eighth of an inch thick.<br /><br />I rarely buy packaged cookies, so I don't have a lot of points of comparison.  The texture of the cookie reminds me a little of a graham cracker, only denser.  There is a strong scent of blueberry and a distinct flavor of dried blueberries.  They are not very sweet, which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />They'd be tasty spread with a little soft mild cheese or peanut butter.  On their own, they're good; just not knock-your-socks-off good.  More of a pleasant snack.  It occurs to me, though, that they'd make an interesting pie crust; similar to the kind you make by crushing graham crackers or chocolate wafers and mixing with butter.  I'm thinking they could be very nice in a pie crust with a vanilla pudding filling.<br /><br />Here's the nutritional scoop:  There are three cookies in a serving size, which results in 140 calories, 5 grams of fat (1g saturated, 3g polyunsaturated, 1g monounsaturated), 90 mg of sodium, 50g of potassium, 21g total carbs, 2g dietary fiber, 8g sugars and 2g protein.  Not too bad as a snack from the nutritional standpoint, at least by comparison to most cookies.  From the ingredient list, they appear to be vegan.  Also, they are sweetened with brown sugar, not high fructose corn syrup.  They do contain wheat and soy products.<br /><br />I'd say go for it if you're looking for a packaged cookie that's on the healthier side.",1.0

"I read a review that stated that these taste like the inside of a peanut butter cup, only a little sweeter. They do not. They have the consistency of what you would find in a peanut butter cup, but not the taste. Another reviewer said these taste just like Mexican wedding cake cookies. This is actually the review that sold me on getting these. They do not taste like that either. I think the consistency is what sold these reviewers on the response that they give. I will admit that the consistency is fun, it's crumbly, and makes it seem more appealing, the flavor is in no way appealing to me.<br /><br />What these do taste like is a mix between powdered sugar and the faintest hint of peanut butter. The powdered sugar overwhelms this product and is not appealing to my taste buds. If you like eating powdered sugar than you will probably enjoy these.

"Frazzles are little crispy-bacon-flavored bites of crunchy corn goodness that must be laced with, I don't know, crack or something. I don't know how else to explain how addictive they are. I mean... bacon! And... NOT ONLY bacon, but they are actually entirely suitable for vegetarians (not that I am one), thus providing a useful public service in that they enable non-meat-eaters who secretly crave bacon every minute of every waking (and even sleeping) hour to get a harmless pork-fix without going near a single meat product. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />Silliness aside, these really are very, very good and are one of those rare childhood staples that honestly taste every bit as good when eaten as an adult as you remember them tasting when scarfed down in the playground in the eighties. For anyone who's never tried Frazzles, I'd describe them as being a bit like Sun Chips if Sun Chips came in crispy bacon flavor... only less healthy-grainy and a bit lighter-textured.<br /><br />Of course, if you're buying on Amazon from British Corner Shop, you may need to order enough of these (and other British goodies) to stock your OWN corner shop just to avoid the shipping costs being prohibitively expensive, but if you can overcome that hurdle, you really can't go wrong in ordering a caseload of Frazzles and stocking up for the next year or several.

If Teddy Roosevelt had been served this coffee at the Maxwell House hotel, Maxwell House may never have earned their colophon (""Good to the last drop."") This beverage boasts of two flavors; peppermint and mocha. Peppermint flavor has a strong beginning and a weak ending. Also the peppermint flavor does not linger. The mocha flavor is weak to non-existent throughout. I tried following the package directions; four teaspoons per six to eight ounces of water. I then kept adding more and more mix. Unfortunately, I could not find an acceptable ratio. This has to be the worst Maxwell House product I have tried. I do not think it is worth the money. It is very expensive. For the same cost, you could buy coffee beans, peppermint candy, cocoa and milk and create a much better home-made concoction.

Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.,2.0

"These are tasty and very satisfying food bars; I keep them on hand for when I'm out and about.  I have them shipped by Amazon's auto-ship to save extra cash.

"The only reason for my low rating of this item is the flavor. I was expecting a light berry flavor, but I would compare the flavor of this tea to the taste of FIG-- and it is a very strong fig flavor & scent. I have always loved Stash brand teas, and the quality and value of their products are exceptional. However, if you are not a big fan of fig, or are looking for a tea that has a berry/acai flavor, I would not recommend this one. Instead, I suggest you try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IX36"">Stash Premium Pomegranate Raspberry Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> It has much more of the flavor I was expecting when I ordered this.

Probably over-powered for the job, but I wanted to make sure it would work through paint (it does).

"I really liked this product, though it did take a couple uses to get it just right. I've found that a little definitely goes a long way. For an 8 oz glass of water, you just want to give the bottle a quick squeeze...any more than that and it's too sweet/strong.<br /><br />Also, you're gonna want to drink this rather quickly. I'm not someone who guzzles their drinks quickly (I can make a single bottle of water last an entire day), and the first time I tried this I took a couple sips, set it on the table and picked it up again after about a half hour or so...YUCK! It was not good. I don't know what happened in that 30 minutes to make the taste change so much, but it's certainly better when it's cold. Overall though, it's pretty good! It has a strong fruit punch flavor, and is much more enjoyable than a glass of plain 'ol water.",1.0
"Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth.",0.0

"I tried this PB2 after reading about it in the Hungry Girl Cookbook. I was amazed at how wonderful it was. You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter, but was doing weight watchers and couldnt justify using my points for real peanut butter. With PB2 I could eat peanut butter all the time and not feel guilty! It gets a little creamier when used with warm toast or on an English Muffin.<br /><br />I brough PB2 to work one day and introduced it to my co-workers. They asked to buy the jar I had left! They then ordered SIX jars for themselves. If you dont mind the calories, you might want to stick to regular peanut butter. But if you want an alternative that tastes just like peanut butter without the oil... this is EXCELLANT. I now actually prefer this to real peanut butter!!",2.0

"Well, the crackers are the same as you get in any package, but this is suppose to be a more convenient, ""fresh""er way of using them. They are wrapped in brown plastic wrap and all the corners are broken, some of the crackers are in pieces. I think there are too many in a pack anyway, 8 crackers is too many to put in a lunch box for a 4 year old. I'd like to see a little sturdier wrapping so the crackers don't break up so easily in the box; and in the lunch box they become a total mess. I'd prefer to buy the regular box of crackers and put the amount I think is right into the divided plastic lunch container I use for his lunches.<br />I even think it's too many for us grownups to enjoy at one time and sort of forces you to eat all 8 crackers in the pack, by suggestion, or risk putting a couple back to get even more broken up.<br />As for the product itself, I love them.",1.0

One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for ""highlighting"" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.",2.0

"I did not hold out much hope for this product. We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites.",1.0

Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.

If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.

"So, I just got my Keurig so naturally, I am online searching for the best variety packs I can find. I must say that the bag was a big sell for me, having 5 kids bags always come in handy. The bag is a lower quality bag, you would not want to stuff a bunch of heavy items and carry it around all day. It would be great for kids to put toys in, light items, etc. Anyway, I reviewed the desription and it sounded pretty exciting to be getting a ""grab bag"" of K-cups essentially. I ordered it with Prime, got within 2 days and started digging. I was a tad dissapointed that is was very Green Mountain brand heavy. I love Green Mountain, but felt that I would get a little more brand variety. I am giving it a 4 star due to that fact. Other than that, there was a ton of different flavors, some bold, some flavored, and some nice classics! The other brands included were Donut House and Revv.<br /><br />Included were:<br /><br />34 Green Mountain brand varities<br />6 Donut House<br />4 Revv<br /><br />36+6+4= 44 so I got a bonus!!!!",1.0
"Excellent tea and I would recommend it to anyone that has not tried it but that loves tea.  I drink it with just a teaspoon of sugar, no milk, and it gets my day started the right way.<br /><br />The big problem with this product is that the price is like a yo-yo bouncing all over the place.  I finally stopped my subscription because of the price jumps and due to the fact that the product is currently much cheaper at Walmart and Target.  The current Amazon price is $2.83 while I can buy it at the above mentioned places for $2.39 a box.

"I received a sample packet of this new sweetener from Amazon as part of their Vine Reviewer program.<br /><br />I'll say up front that my ""regular"" sweetener is Sweet `n Low and I guess I'm accustomed to it. I use about 2/3 of a ""pink packet"" in an 10 oz cup of coffee or 12 oz glass of iced tea and it's just the right sweetness. I've tried both Splenda (the company that makes Nectresse) and Equal and I find that a full ""yellow"" or ""blue"" packet is not sweet enough. So this was a good chance to try something new.<br /><br />Honestly, while it didn't have an ""after taste"" it didn't blow me away. There are other things to consider when choosing a ""calorie-free"" sweetener that I'd like to point out:<br /><br />1- These zero calorie sweeteners will help those on a diet but only so much. A teaspoon of sugar contains only 15 calories. So we are talking about saving 30 calories here; that's not much.<br /><br />2- There are four  ingredients to Nectress and one of them is ""sugar"".  Here's the description: Ingredients Erythritol, Sugar, Monk Fruit Extract, Molasses. But still no ""calories"". The Monk Fruit is the difference. Note also that the product is white so the sugar is obviously ""refined"".<br /><br />3- If I read the package correctly it is not made for baking. So consider that. It comes only in packets that are about twice as thick as a normal SUGAR packet. Someone did point out - see their comment - that the website says it can be used in baking.)<br /><br />And then there is the issue of cost. You will note that - at least as of today (July 4th) the product is ""not yet available"" and there is no price. I think people consider their sweeteners also based on cost. So I can't pass judgment on the value or cost/benefit of Nectresse until pricing is available.<br /><br />I'll finish using the 40-pack samples that Amazon sent to Vine reviewers as it still works. But I'll withhold final judgement until the product becomes widely available.<br /><br />And, like any food product, remember that TASTE is SUBJECTIVE.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />""Anything Phonographic""",1.0

"I think this stuff is disgusting. I have been hearing about the ""wonderfulness"" of Kombucha and instead of getting a can from my local health food store, I bought a case thinking I was saving a lot of money. I do not know good Kombucha from bad Kombucha, but who could tell the difference? It must be an acquired taste because I am pretty adventurous in food and drink. If you are unfamiliar with Kombucha, it is fermented tea, which tastes yeasty, moldy, spoiled and vinegary all at once. Also, it smells like dirty socks. It is like drinking something that has been hiding in the back of the fridge since christmas of 1988. Ewww!! Since my hairdresser chatters all the time about this stuff, he is getting 23 cans as a tip next time. I gave it 2 stars because it might just be the best Kombucha ever but I will never know. P.s. Kombucha used to have a bit of alcohol in it from the fermentation untill Lidnsay Lohan supposedly tested positive after drinking some (?), ruining Kombucha for everyone. Now it doesn't have any alcohol, I dont know how they get it out though.

"I, like another reviewer, wanted that delicious clear broth with mushrooms and onions in it in a japanese restaurant. This soup looks like it, but certainly wasnt the taste I was expecting, and didnt taste like the soup id get locally. Oh well. Regarding the actual taste, its most prominent flavor is fish. I thought it was too fishy, but I do understand people have different tastes so I wont knock its rating down for that.<br /><br />The reason I gave it only 2 stars is what I didnt taste or see. The next prominent flavor is soy sauce. Other then that, theres really not much to this soup. The mushroom and onion ""flakes"" (I would call them slivers) are small in number and dont contribute much. There were a total of 3 pieces of wheat which added very little. At over a dollar per packet I would say the value is pretty bad. Ramen noodles are cheaper then this, and you get more in the seasoning packet from those then this soup. I would have liked to see larger sized mushrooms and onion. It doesnt really look like the picture - my soup was some straight slivers the thickness of rice grains sitting at the bottom. They were pretty pathetic. I dont believe kikkoman is a ""higher quality"" and thus you get what you pay for. They could have included more dehydrated onions or scallion. I was disappointed.<br /><br />If you like fish, you might like this soup, but I didnt enjoy it and dont think its a good value. To me, I would call this soup ""fish broth with added soy sauce"". I just didnt get any of that ""mmm!"" umami flavor that I recognize. Im sure some people will really like the flavor of this soup, but I'd highly recommend trying to buy one packet locally so you can try it before buying in bulk. If you dont like fish, dont bother at all.<br /><br />Oh well, i'm going to try their miso soup next.",0.0

It's creamier and melts instantly unlike other coconut oils. I've been using it on my face and body. I honestly notice a difference in my skin.  It's looks clearer and feels more moisturized. I hope they never stop making and or selling it on Amazon. I will definitely buy again.,2.0

"Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that ""crunch"" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)<br /><br />Note: Of them all I believe this to be my least favorite flavor.  Why? Because it is the blandest.  I think this was intended to be the one that entices ordinary Americans unfamiliar with Asian foods into sampling their products, but in the process they overdid it, producing a rather boring extremely mild tasting chicken soup with of course their excellent thick, soft, Hokkien noodles.

"I've had a recipe for Fattoush Salad for years.  Every once in a while, usually after making a batch of pita bread I'd think about Fattoush and wonder where I could find Sumac (one of the essential and authentic ingredients).  Finally, it occurred to me that I could order it, online!  Duh!  Sometimes I'm slow, so then I looked around, a lot of the other vendors on here were offering truly hugemongous amounts of Sumac and my recipe calls for just one teaspoon, what would I do with a pound?<br /><br />Also, I wasn't sure if I would like the taste of sumac.  The descriptions I read for it said it was 'lemon-y, but not bitter, sherbet-y (sherbet flavored herbs??) anyways, I just couldn't be sure if it would be tasty to me and I wasn't willing to risk much on a bottle of herbs that I might end up tossing.<br /><br />Well, from the moment I opened the bottle, I knew I liked sumac.  It is a little citrus-y smelling, but I also recognized the smell, it is mouth puckeringly familiar, it smells like A-1 Steak Sauce to me, or rather, the one ingredient I could never completely identify, tart, savory with a fruity punch.  I don't mean to go all smarmy-foodie about this, but I am feeling rather enthusiastic about this, new-to-me, spice.<br /><br />Okay, so onto product packaging. my spice came in a plastic bottle, not a resealable bag.  The bottle was sealed and the seal was unbroken.",1.0
"As of this writing there have been 255 reviews posted. Sorta difficult to add anything new. I received one bag of this coffee from the Vine program. The day preceding its arrival I had brewed some French Vanilla by a brand that I regularly use and which is rated higher than Starbucks by the best known testing and rating org. This offered me an opportunity to make a somewhat taste comparison although, admittedly, the Starbucks was not French Vanilla.<br /><br />In the taste test Starbucks came in second. It was neither as smooth nor as tasty as the competitor. I drink my coffee with fat-free milk and no sugar so I get a fairly good opportunity to evaluate the taste. Starbucks afficionados undoubtedly will praise this and they have every right to do so and I have no quarrel with that.

It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.

"RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />""Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: ""includes mutant organisms"" and ""recombinant organisms"", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is ""extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.""<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA.  All of them include GMOs.  GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />  Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!!

"I ordered both xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell.  Kinda like mothballs.  They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination.  I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable).  She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again.  Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before.  (Note:  I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question.  I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same.  Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site.  While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc.  Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried.  I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar.

She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing.  How was I to know the substance would smell so badly?  She said I should have just ordered one.  What difference does it make since I had only opened one?  The others were perfectly sealed.  She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me.  (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />I stand by my post.

"I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health.

"Stewart's had abandoed us by no longer making the best of ginger beers.  Fever-Tree is a bit milder than Stewarts though not as sweet but unlike Goya which I tried to live with, it does not inflame your intestines on the way down!  It is obviously expensive and the bottles are tiny so I have two suggestions:  The first is that Fever-Tree consider selling the public the concentrate and let us mix our own.  The product I believe is made in the UK and shipped to California most likely in that concentrated form anyway.  By going that route or adding it to their product line, we would not have to pay for heavy glass bottles of fizzy water.<br /><br />My other suggestion is to mix a couple of inches from the Fever-Tree bottle with something like Arizona's very bland Diet Iced Tea.  It punches up the tea and certainly stretches the number of glasses of the ginger beer we can taste.  No one can afford these days to drink Fever-Tree straight on a daily basis.  But it is a worthwhile contender to the void Stewart's has created and I for one will never understand.",1.0

"You organic types can fool yourselves into all sorts of B.S. Zevia is gross, tastes unnatural, not sweet.  If you want to be orgnaic, GREAT, drinks some water, it certainly tastes better than Zevia (so bad, I can not believe the postive reviews). If you want a diet soda, get something from Dr Pepper/Snapple (A&W, Ginger Ale, etc.), they are the best.",0.0
"This is my favorite tea (in bagged tea) and I wanted to try it out loose since that makes better tea.  I just finished up a tin of Fortnum and Mason's English Breakfast loose tea and thought Twining's Irish Breakfast would be just as good, hopefully better.<br /><br />Well, it tastes better than F&M's and the bagged version (yay!), but the tea is not really loose leaf--the leaves are coarsely chopped--so tea dust penetrates the metal strainer system I use--a system that has worked very well for the every other loose leaf tea variety I've ever tried.  I suppose I can brew it with a paper straining method, but the cut up look to the tea makes it look like someone just cut open a hundred tea bags and dumped them into my tin...disappointing...tasty, but could it be better?",1.0

"This coffee really has more of a vanilla scent than a vanilla taste. Adding a little vanilla flavoring to the pot gave it a more satisfying vanilla flavor. I was surprised to see that it is 100% Arabica beans as it is also a little bitter despite being a medium roast.<br /><br />Overall, a decent but not exciting cup of coffee without any chemical or artificial taste that flavored coffees sometimes have.<br /><br />Note that this product is not whole coffee beans but rather is already milled to what is called a ""universal grind"" which is intended for drip coffee makers.<br /><br />It seems like a long time ago that a pound of coffee was 16 oz. but I suppose that this 11 oz. ""one pound"" bag is appropriate company for those 64 oz. ""five pound"" bags of sugar and those 59 oz.

"I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing.",0.0

"... and these do!!<br /><br />Wow!  I was really surprised at how good these chips are.  These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.  Yum!!<br /><br />I'll definitely be purchasing these from Amazon -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them!",2.0

You can use these hash browns for everyday use, cooking for large groups or fundraisers, emergencies, and camping.<br />They are very simple to prepare just cover the amount of hash browns that you want with hot water and let sit for about 10 minutes and fry until golden brown. They crisp up real nice, just like you get in a restaurant. You can also use them in casseroles or whatever else you'd use frozen hash browns for.",0.0

"I ordered this a month or 2 ago (from a different site) as I use the Ener-g bread for making stuffing.  If it weren't for it being shelf stable and cheap shipping, I would not buy this brand.  All of their breads are crumbly and dry.  I do remember having their sweet loaf years ago and liking it.<br />Today when I went to open this loaf to dry it some more for stuffing, I noticed it has white spots- either flecks of flour or mold- I am not sure.  It doesn't taste moldy but maybe it is hard to tell as all the Ener-g breads I have tried have a strangely distinct vinegar-like smell and taste.  Not sure if I should go ahead with my stuffing or skip it.  No stuffing on thanksgiving is a bummer.  I'm 300 miles from a store that carries anything GF.  Disappointed- may have to find a different GF bread for stuffing.  Maybe I'll break down and make some yummy fresh bread and skip the stuffing.",0.0

I substitute 1/2 & 1/2, buttermilk or cream for the liquid for a richer flakier scone. Add a tablespoon of sugar and it makes great shortcake too.

"I'm 19 and have been working out for about two years now. When I started I was told I needed to start taking a protein supplement. So like every newbie, I figured GNC was the place to go. I was told to start using the wheybolic protein by the salesman so I did. However, it was becoming too pricey and I was getting headaches regularly. Shortly after, I read in consumer reports that there are various heavy metals found in the mix. I immediately began looking for a healthy and natural alternative. I found Nutiva organic hemp protein and decided to give it a try. It's been six months and I'm hooked. This stuff is great. It's organic (which is always a plus) and it is great for you. I am able to obtain lean protein after each workout and I'll even drink it with my breakfast in the morning to start my day the right way.

"I purchased this on a whim and drank before I sat down to study for a neuro (ironic, no?) exam in the wee hours of the night. I was skeptical about the effects but within the hour, felt more awake. I have to agree that is an energy drink done right. There was no crash, shakes, jitters but natural feeling energy. I didn't focus any better but was able to stay awake long enough to read a few chapters of my book and retain the info. My biggest problem was it is SO SO SO carbonated! It's harsh and the flavor is yucky. I felt like I was downing medicine in order to get my energy boost. The sucralose after taste is especially apparent in this Neuro. I'm drinking the Trim as I write this review and it is much yummier.",1.0
"I had such high hopes for these but, as another reviewer noted, they taste no different than store-bought maraschino cherries.

They are a little smaller than standard refrigerated tofu (12 oz vs 16 oz).  They are also silk tofu so they don't hold  their shape as well, which is good for certain things like fried rice or chocolate mousse.  Not great if you are making tofu steaks or strips.",1.0

"Doing a food item is always difficult, individual taste and preference being a major reason why we like or dislike something.  Breakfast cereal might be one of the more difficult items.  Having written disclaimers, here is my review.<br />This is a heavily sweetened item with 120 calories in ¾ of a cup.  In addition, there are peanut chips stuck to the flakes.  Honey and molasses are the major sweeteners.  The result is a corn flake with peanut slivers and honey that has a sweet pleasant taste.  The flakes hold up well in milk or can be eaten dry as a snack.  I think this would make an excellent base for a sweet trail mix snack.  My two-year old grandson likes them dry in his dish as a snack.<br />This might be an alternate to the heavily sugar sweeten cereals but is not a good choice for anyone looking to control their weight.",1.0

"I have to say that I have brewed for Coopers Kits at this point and this is most likely the best... Not necessarily because this product is more superior then the others kits but I added a few more ""things"" as I become a more experienced brewer. First, you can not produce a true Wheat Beer buy utilizing Coopers standard ale yeast... Therefore, I went with a liquid Wyeast stain. Also, I boiled the 1.5 liters of water as per the coopers instructions but I added a 1/2 oz of Bitter orange peal and 1 tsp of Corriander. This really gave the beer a nice Orange zest which is a true Southern Germany/Munich style wheat beer. However, I do believe simply making the kit as is will produce good beer just like the other kits.",2.0

"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these crackers - I am always a bit wary of trying GF products since so many have a strange taste and/or texture. These, however, are delicious. They do remind me of Ritz crackers (at least what I remember from eating them 2 years ago) except not quite as oily.<br /><br />Good:<br />- They taste good and have a really nice texture.<br />- I don't think they are exceptionally bland - they have a slight buttery flavor and seem like generic crackers to me. Definitely more flavor that water crackers<br />- I don't taste the funny aftertaste that one of the reviewers mentions. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to that taste than I am.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Cost<br />- Broken crackers: I agree with other reviewers that the packages often contain a lot of broken ones. This is not just when they are purchased online; it is also true of boxes that I've purchased at a store like Whole Foods. I guess these crackers are just fragile and need special packaging.<br /><br />That combination of downsides makes it a tough choice for me about whether to buy these crackers. Do I really want to pay a lot (3-4x as much as ""glutinized"" crackers) for a box of broken crackers? I haven't decided. For now, they are a splurge that I indulge in occasionally.",1.0

"I bought 2 variety packs and the  flavors seem to be fairly decent and varied especially taking into consideration the low price. My only problem and the reason for knocking off 2 stars is the inclusion of 4 cider K-cups in each package. 1/6 of the order consisted of non coffee products and the description specifically states ""This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee"".<br /><br />I purchased this for $14.25 and noticed only 3 days after ordering, the price had increased to $17.18. I know it's only a few dollars, but as the price increases I find it difficult to justify buying this product again.

"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading.

"I'ma fairly healthy eater, but I LOVE chips.  Potato chips, tortilla chips, I like them all.  Popchips offer a chip like substance,with the promise of low fat.<br /><br />They crunch like chips but don't quite have a chip like texture; it's closer to a rice cake.  The seasoning is decent as well.  They have a surprising amount of a great sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients are okay as far as healthiness.  I like that rice flour is the first ingredient rather than potatoes or corn.  You still get oil, although less than normal chips.  There's more salt and sugar than I would like.<br /><br />In the end I found myself munching through the case of 24 fairly quickly.  Popchips taste good and aren't as bad for you.

"What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Celestial, and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.",0.0

"This is a shame. When Merricks introduced its canned cat foods, they were truly out-standing.  There was no filler of excess liver, no bone, no cartlidge, no cheap grindings swimming in gravy--things which are typical of the majority of cat food producers.  There was minimum grain and lots of turkey, in addition to the obvious nutritious veggies and berries. Merricks truly was the King. However, as I continued to buy over time, I noticed a distinct degrading of quality.  I usually buy directly from the company's website so I addressed these issues to them the day I found chunks of obvious poulty vertabra and cartlidge, large chunks--whole vertabra bones-- and ground, in a particular lot.  I had already seen the qualities of the foods going downhill but this addition of bone and cartlidge was upsetting. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and wrote to inform them that perhaps an ""accident"" had happened. They were cold, uncaring and wanted my remaining cans after I send them photographs of the foods, bones and cartlige matter and cans with the lot numbers clearly stamped. I admit I blew my stack at this attitude, but the last straw was receiving the final lot(which unfortunately I had ordered before the discovery of the literal garbage in the previous lot) and the result of the new came pouring out of the cans in a gray-ish brown mass of ""gravy"", with no visible pieces of turkey, just unhealthy-looking masses of liver and some cheap ground poultry that was hard and brittle to the fingers.  Merricks has been informed that they have a problem with quality control and the customer should be very aware that the lots differ dramatically. I'm very glad I kept and presevered the cans, bones and photographs as proof. If you want to pay premium prices for the kind of crap you throw away in your garbage every day then by all means buy Merricks and take a chance. It's feast or famine from a company who has clearly taken advantage of the fact that most consumers really don't bother looking at their cat's food. Shame on them for feeding cats and kittens bones and cartlidge and liver-filler. Merricks blows.",0.0

"There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept.

"We've enjoyed Bob's Red Mill products for a long time, and I was delighted with this soup mix too.  Like some other reviewers said, it is plain and mostly unseasoned, but that is the beauty of it.  It's a good mix of vegetable pasta, barley, dried peas and lentils.  It's quick-cooking and rich and filling, but it needs seasoning and either meat or veggies added to it.  We like adding ham chunks, chopped spinach, onion, cracked pepper and canned crushed tomatoes, but we also like it with chorizo sausage (pre-cooked!), and mixed frozen vegetables.  I added some chopped cabbage once and it was great.  It thickens as the peas and lentils cook, so you can add more or less water as you wish.<br /><br />One of the best things about this soup base is that you add your own salt.  So many products come heavily and unhealthily salted but not this one. It's much better to add your own as desired!<br /><br />This soup is a little expensive - about $4 per bag - but it makes a big pot of soup, and with free SuperSaver shipping it's a good deal and something that I'll order again.",1.0

"I apologize to the makers of this drink for saying this, but it is just not good. At all. To be honest I think it tastes curiously like mouthwash. I can't really get past that and enjoy it. It's almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something. I am a HUGE fan of Synergy/GT's Kombucha, but I thought I'd try this because it's slightly cheaper. I have to say that the Synergy is well worth the extra $12 per 12 bottle case (I purchase the cases at Whole Foods for $35).<br /><br />Even if I could get past the minty mouthwash taste, I still have to question the health benefits of this brand of Kombucha given the ingredients list. It reads: Lightly carbonated water, sucrose, herbal tea blend, Kombucha cultures, lactobacilli, acerola juice concentrate. You don't even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar?? One can drink seltzer water with sugar and ""herbal tea"" for much cheaper than $23/12 bottles. Seriously. Spend the extra few bucks and buy the Synergy, whose ingredients are as follows (this is for the ""Trilogy"" flavor): 95% GT's organic raw kombucha, raspberry juice, lemon juice, fresh pressed ginger juice, and 100% pure love.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want mint soda, then by all means, seize the day. If you want real, raw kombucha with health benefits AND a delicious taste, go for Synergy/GT's Kombucha.",0.0
