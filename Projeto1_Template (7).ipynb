      "['these look delicious and when you first chew they are delicious but it did not take long before i started feeling nauseated and ill there is also a terrible aftertaste that lingers for a while be careful', 'whenever i give my dogs something to chew on i hope it keeps them busy for a while and tire them out  these fun bites are too big for my chihuahua it is suggested for dogs over six pounds but for my medium sized mix breed it would take her about a half an hour to finish them off  i really cannot comment on the digestive support that the fun bites advertise but she does not seem any different as to the way then before she ate these  what is annoying about this product is the labeling as they have important data and warning on the bottom of the package making it very hard to read it without ripping or cutting it  if it is important how about putting the warning wear someone can actually read it', 'this rum cake has little chocolate flaver and chocolate color i dont know why it dosent says on box it is very moist i wish it not so bitter', 'my dog loved the original purina one adult chicken with rice dog food  however since purina developed the smartblend she wont eat it unless i add some turkey  the tan color pieces are awful  kind of rubbery  i went back to buying the regular purina chicken and rice mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color  my dog really likes the older version much better  i wont be buying the blend mixture again sometimes change isnt better', 'as like the others have already said a very delicious rich strong coffee that will keep you going all day it is very good by itself or with milk or my personal favorite some chocolate coffee creamer i purchased both jet fuel and wake up call they are both very smooth and i use them interchangeably the packaging and delivery was top notch as is usual with amazon amazon is the best place to purchase any kcups as can be found out by price comparison to other retailers', 'being a saltfree product is why i purchased this but the chips are quite greasy', 'i bought several different brands of the chai concentrate from amazon as there are few options in my rural areas grocery stores  the tazo organic chai is my favorite  it most closely matches that served by starbucks  only difference is it doesnt have the foam  ive been told it is what they use  tazo decaf is my second choice  strangely it is not as good as the tazo organic chai not as spicy but ok for drinking in the evening  the oregon chai original is not as good in my opinion as the tazo  it is missing something  not enough cardamon or pepper or something  the oregon chai sugarfree was very disappointing  i was hoping there was a good sugarfree option out there as id like to avoid the daily calories from my chai habit  it just takes like plain tea with mil in my opinion  it seems to mostly lack the complex spicy flavor or the tazo chai  not sure why that is  the sweetener should have no bearing on the other ingredients  i have been unable to find any suitable concentrated sugarfree chai tea options  post if you find one', 'kind bar is little like fine dinning they dont give you a huge portion and its quite expensive compared to others but the portion they give you is so good this is one of the few health bar that doesnt give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward  as a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something so for the past few years ive been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk usually that stash consist of items on sale from either amazon or vons ive many different bars from clif bar nature valleys granola bar to balance bar none of them can compare to kind bar ive actually never heard about this company until a sale on amazon but due to great reviews which is why i want to put in my 2 cents as well', 'best hazelnut flavored coffee i have found  the kcups came in one box  the kcups are so easy to use  delivered fast as well', 'well i have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible its good for you but i just couldnt do it it might be a good protein shake but its extremely salty i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse = too bad because i was looking forwards to see some results', 'when i opened the package the salt did not look right i compared it to some of the himalayan salt i had from whole foods and it was a lighter pink opened the bag and tasted it it sure tasted like regular salt was added great price but you get what you pay for nice trick', 'speedy shipment on this producthave not tried it yet but the quality packaging and so forth seem very good', 'these are decent sun dried tomatoes but they are not what is described they are dried tomatoes in a pouch there is no olive oil and there is no jar this is not what i ordered both the photograph and the item description are incorrect amazon was nice enough about refunding my money once i found a way to contact them by phone', 'zoe lifestyle treats for dogs are a healthy alternative to the typical highcalorie dog snacks which you find in stores today the product is glutenfree and is a good source of soluble fiber these treats are as hard as a rock which would probably be troublesome for older dogs with poor teeth i tested these treats on a 2yearold lab and a 9yearold golden retriever keep in mindthey will eat just about anything both dogs threw the sticks on the ground and proceeded to sniff them  i am not sure but i think the cinnamon spice flavor threw them off a bit  after rolling the sticks around on the ground i am happy to report that they ate them the next day i offered them another treat and they didnt seem too excited overall if you are into healthy dog food these snacks are sensible treats personally i wouldnt buy them again due to the price and the firmness of the product i would be concerned that my dog would break a tooth', 'what more can you say slim jim is known commodity with reliable texture and the favor of this product lives up to its billing  amazon is providing a great price point', 'the texture of this is beautifulthe taste is frankly yucky at first i thought it tasted a little like artificial lemon flavoring rather than cheesecake but then the aftertaste is really unpleasant very artificial bummer', 'definitely use the smallest amount of water and be sure to shake the cup before brewing  the kids got a kick out of making their own kid coffee but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and brewed it with 3 marshmallows on top the hot cocoa hitting the marshmallows releases added sugar as well as turns the marshmallows nice and mushy   the rest of us dont care to waste our daily calories on something that was in our opinion chocolatey water  still it was worth the price for the simple fact that the kiddos can come in from sledding and brew their own hot cocoa without much mess', 'this cheese is wonderful  it reminds of my youth in lebanon pa  combine this

kids love them i feel good about giving them a healthier snack the only reason i didnt give them a 5star is becuase each bag comes with 2 servings in it this makes them a little less convenient to use

chicken so much for truth in advertising there actually was no broccoli either  just some sawdust apparently swept off the floor  i went to publix and bought some chicken and followed the instructions on the back of the box i did not of course add the sawdust after adding the cheese i tried a sample and it was edible but not with much of a flavor it was just ok but no great shakes that is my reason for the three stars  i then added a can of rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles this i topped of with my favorite seasonings and some crumbled publix saltines the result was a much improved meal with a significantly improved taste  i actually cannot see any reason for buying this product you would do better to buy some orzo chicken and your favorite type of cheese you most likely have some seasonings already if you want to add brocolli buy some fresh and steam it for a few minutes and throw it into the mix add whatever your imagination and taste buds find pleasurable you will have a far superior meal', 'this mix makes nice crispy waffles but the flavor was surprisingly bland  next time i make them ill throw in a tablespoon or two of sugar and see if that helps  i was hoping for a mix

as people find out whats real and can avoid my mistakes  i got my wonderful little sweet bella bean when she was a few days shy of three years old she had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap i have had cats around me my entire life for about twentyfive years now my mother always just fed them whatever the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket  friskies nine lives kit  kaboodle stuff like that and our cats were always fine at least in terms of their eating habits they would eat in the morning stop when they were done come back and eat some more when they got hungry  my housemate at the time was working for hills and assured me that this was the best food ever made so great so on and so forth i now know that she is an utter buffoon but i initially trusted her judgment which is so unfortunate because she doesnt think she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags which made it a much more attractive choice  i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl but that didnt work as she would devour it in one sitting so then i took to measuring it and she did the same thing then i started parsing it out to twice a day that didnt work either because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day running around intentionally destroying things deliberately spilling her water crying etc until she got more food so then i split it into three servings same thing then it got to be four servings that was a little better but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times so then it went back to three all the while i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby reducing was hell she became even more hungry but i figured she would get used to it not really  for over a year she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way knocking things off my desk ripping up any paper she could find scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief as soon as she got food she was back to her sweet self but only for three or four hours  we thought she was bored we thought she was a little nutty and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder she always wanted food it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad  a few weeks back we took her to a new good nonmoney factory vet for her second checkup since ive had her i talked with him about her being always hungry he asked what she ate and i told him the adult indoor science diet without saying as much he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients science diet does in a very loose byproduct kind of way  ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning not that i care about spending money on the bean but this food is way too expensive for what it is  so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago she is still eating 50 percent science diet with 50 percent wellness you really shouldnt just give a cat different food one day out of the blue but she never freaks out anymore its amazing and its 100 percent because she is eating real food now along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her we have her down to eating twice a day only 1/3 cup in total she was eating three times a day 5/8 of a cup in total now she eats some in the morning walks away eats some more a few hours later and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding no more knocking things over no more trashing dads papers on the desk no more howling no more deliberately spilled water on the floor its incredible  i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever but no she was genuinely hungry because she wasnt eating any real food  do your cat a favor  buy her or him so food made with real

much they liked them and almost everyday during the christmas break they wanted a bag for their afternoon snack they have tried all the flavors in the variety pack and i have not heard any objections

spout  also the tea blossoms are not labeled  you have to guess by matching the picture to the little balls of tea in a bag and hope you got the right one  the tea is light if you dont like strong tea

not actual tea cup then you will get about 1 1/2 cups of tea each time you fill it  the blossoms also will come apart slightly and you will get small tea leaves in your cup i would suggest using a tea strainer  if you dont own a tea strainer already you can  use a coffee filter to catch the smaller pieces of tea leaves by simply holding it over your cup as you pour allowing the tea to filter

fan of keurig brewing i was delighted to discover solofill cups  i have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this kcup replacement  unlike the my kcup

main appeal of this  you can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey prefilled kcups  it makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please  some users have complained about cleaning the solofill  i find it easy  just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out  then rinse it out and its ready to go again  i keep two handy so i can be using one and cleaning the other  i see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you

to be an antioxidant that is a very tenuous assumption that has not been fully proven the only ingredients that might be healthy are the cherries and the oats i eat zone nutrition bars and kellogs fiber plus bars both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients  i read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these eat think smile

sweet and did not taste cherry like to me if you are looking for a great tasting real nutrition bar then check out the zone nutrition bars or the kellogs fiber plus bars or any of the other real nutrition bars and when you do compare fat calories carbs vitamins and such before you ever consider buying these fake health bars  if you like gritty cookies with mostly no taste very sweet and

for a better quality food because they will never feel full cats need to eat meat and there just isnt real meat in this food when purchasing a cat or dog food the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for i usually buy my pets all natural foods such as natural

garnish mix put it in the microwave and cook for one minute then you take it out and using the lid drain the water out  i tried putting the mix on the bottom of the noodles but they still came out when i poured the water out and i agree with the other reviewer that the lid isnt the best way to strain the water out and thats why i deducted onestar maybe next time i wont add as much water or something  from there you just add in the sauce mix and the noodle dish is done', 'these cookies were disgusting  it tasted like two dry crackers with a tiny bit of dry frosting in the middle  i

inside the box  and was a decent sized bottle both my wife and i love real white and black truffles and we thought the oil smelled wonderful but to be honest we are somewhat disappointed with the flavor which was metallic and overly meaty in taste also the bottle opening does not have a flow drip control so instead of using a few drops/drizzle it tends to pour out and you need to be very careful not to use too much or it ruins/overwhelms the food dish maybe we got a funky bottle but we were hoping for a better gourmet experience', 'the tiny nuts under the overwhelming ball of

not that i ever do that but if you need a little treat in the afternoon its tasty with a cup of joe  the cranberries made this chewy which was a nice combination like pinwheel cookies putting two textures together can be tricky and if not done correctly is a real turnoff for me but here the crunchy/chewy textures enhance each other  my family tasted these as well one of my kids liked the cookie but thought the calorie count a little high for a serving of three 140 calories not a big deal but if youre going for the healthconscious crowd that may be a little too steep other household members said these cookies were average but then they lean toward big gooey chocolate desserts  so try thesebut dont forget to fire up mr coffee first', 'i love diet raspberry snapple so i ordered

youre trying to eat 57 meals a day to lose weight make one of these cups one of your meals the protein fills you up and makes you feel good  it also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience  why eat a nutritionally empty 100 calorie pack of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit  ill eat these alone straight from the cup basically anywhere since you dont need to refridgerate and you dont need a can opener  ill dump them onto salad or mix with rice quinoa or beans

really cant beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration  the package says in water but theres a little bit of broth in the cup and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg  i highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well  but avoid the tuna salad or the flavored varieties if

could be me  yes i will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me  to me smells like this health food store i used to frequent in the hyde park neighborhood  very musky but weirdly comforting  i have tried it with peppermint turmeric for a different affliction and i have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me  i wouldnt say i have an iron stomach because i can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature  for me this product took about two days for it to kick in and i am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here wake up for about two hours sleep for three wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours  for those with sensitive noses and sense of taste you have been amply warned by other reviewers  for others i say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit  there are some great suggestions mentioned by other

ingredients dha from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type however there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a july 2012 expiration date  first there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal this oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color all other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent lightkhaki color  second the happybellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula when i use gerber oatmeal with dha and probiotics this makes the formula very thick  sludgelike with the happybellies no matter how much i add it doesnt thicken the formula at all it remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively  third i think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal he has no issue using the nonorganic gerber oatmeal with dha and probiotics but with the happybellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset he also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on happybellies after a couple of days  i agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal i suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can thus causing a bad smell a grey color and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution the grey color has even made me wonder if its mold that has grown on the oatmeal  its very clear to me that happybellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product', 'this is the only catnip our cat will have anything to do with and she loves

to really like this food i am not sure if it was the taste or if it was the terrible gas or diarrhea it gave them it would sit in their bowl for hours before they finally gave in and finished it  after much thought we decided that we would rather our dogs enjoy their food and not suffer from daily diarrhea than force them to eat this food even if it might extend their life a little  we settled

that it was mostly gravy  a few bits of chicken and some carrots but mostly sauce all of the cans were like that  not just the first one charlie aged 16 liked the sauce but wouldnt touch the solids for a couple of days i only put out the petite cuisine wet food and most of it just sat there hmmmmmm with seven cats youd think at least one of them would clean it up one of the claims on the packaging is that there isnt the odor from this food that there is in other brands and thats very true when the food is fresh i learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when its been sitting out for more than a day my next test was to put out a can of friskies wet food and a can of petite cuisine at feeding time for several days the friskies went right down and the petite cuisine just sat there i used the whole case eventually but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet amazons case price is a little under 1 per threeounce can so thats kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain my advice would be to not buy several cases of petite cuisine initially  see if your cat likes it first mine sure werent impressed', 'my dog loves these

good and feels good  it doesnt have that unpleasant overly watery and grimy texture of the worlds most famous instant coffee brand  i would rate via at about 94 of the quality of a cup of traditional brewed coffee i dont use it as a replacement for my brewed coffee but if the coffee pot at work is empty and i need a quick pickme up via is just the ticket  this could work just fine as a substitute

enjoy vita cocos coconut water products the taste is light refreshing and hardly sweet at all and yes it is thirstquenching however i do not recommend this larger packaging size the other tetra

this variety and the regular goldfish other than the welcome absense of that paprika taste both are mildly cheesy in flavor and for my tastes a bit on the bland side  because of this blandness and lack of total satisfaction i find it easy to overeat when snacking on these  crackers  the package touts 0g of trans fat be aware that the total fat content of a serving 55 pieces is five grams of fat a serving also delivers 140 calories im sure i never eat less than two servings at a time when snacking on goldfish  the lack of artificial flavors is a good thing and also handy is that kids love

was quite frustrated i helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope he pulled quite hard for a good five minutes after which one piece of kibble fell out  hes actually quite clever and hes extremely food motivated i dont know if something was wrong with this particular tug a jug that it was so difficult to get the treats out but its definitely not working out  i only give two stars because he did not destroy it although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part he did leave scratches all over it but hasnt yet managed to crack it however i

'i have been enjoying coconut water for over 2 years  for the most part i love the natural regular variety but was able to buy a variety pack through amazon  after tasting the different flavored varieties i found that i liked the tangerine but loved the peach/mango  so far the boxes i have enjoyed have been very consistent in flavor which is the only downside to coconut water that i have found to date  what i particularly liked about these waters was the container  it has a small screw top that makes the container resealable and less likely to spoil and/or spill in between drinks  at 17 ounces it is unlikely for me to finish drinking it in one sitting so i really appreciate this small innovation  i wish they could do this on the 11 ounce containers but this product is costly enough without adding to the expense  i am giving this particular product 5 stars because of the combination of great taste and the innovative packaging  if you need to pay attention to sugar stick with the unflavored coconut waters because this is sweet with about twice the natural sugars of the unflavored  not a reason to downgrade the product but something to make a note of if sugar is an issue in your life  give it a try and enjoy', 'have enjoyed annies white mac  cheese very much but this microwavable variety is more trouble than its worth  you must use a very deep  wide bowl to use

of garlic or onion flavor i was really anticipating the garlicky and oniony taste of the of the yukon gold chips i was looking closely at the packaging and noticed that the plain chips were pictured i

lid snaps on firmly to the disposakup after you fill it with your favorite coffee or tea  however the problem comes with the filter which wicks the hot coffee under pressure out of the disposakup from under the lid  i tried several of these disposakups after the first few leaked i thought maybe i was not snapping the lid on tight enough so i made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on really tight no gaps they still leaked about 5 or 6 drops from each disposakup which then drips outside the kkup holder chamberand outside the catch area  i needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use  i give this item 3 stars because they do work and are a great idea but the design of the filter protruding from around the cap causes the leaking  if you dont mind a bit of cleanup after each useyoull appreciate these  ill use the rest of the box and continue cleaning up after each use but i wont buy more  the seller offered a refund but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as i would receive as a refund', 'im not a picky personi use folgers instant decaf coffeeand happy with it but i saw this brand at amazon and thought i will try iti didnt like it at all i

in at around plus or minus 2 of those numbers  the candy was a hit w/ my munchkins its true but i felt cheated and so did they that there wasnt a better balance of flavors  they got sick of the

friends house and have tried them in three different keurig machines just to make sure mine didnt need to be descaled so i guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes', 'i

unfortunately the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin after i read the entire ingredient listing i was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners  i do have sensitive skin which i am certain caused the reaction  i dont think this product is for sensitive skin but be sure to read the entire

around they too only lasted about 10 minutes before they were completely devoured as well  soon after my puppy had one side torn completely off and reduced to little blue plastic bits  while both of

pound  however most of us dont want slimy hands all day so we use treats i use these out when walking my dog and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes i like them because they are

more subtle flavor however if you prefer more herbal punch you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone or make your own mix which is quite easy to do otherwise you will be fighting with the salt  if you need to watch your sodium intake you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt  and the crystals are very large so it is easy to over salt your dish you will be fine if you make

the fragrance was very potent and lovely i also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twistonlid  this will help maintain freshness  all said i highly recommend this product with the reservations

floor and slurp up the sauce afterward theres just too much liquid in this cat food the sesame chicken is a bit more solid  whatever the consistency my cat gave this product high stars if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication and i have to admit it smells pretty darn good not like a lot of cat foods of course funky smells have never bothered my cat  the more odorous the better in her

experience and i am reluctant to try them yet ', 'this is one of my favorite healthy cereals  its high in protein and fiber and doesnt contain artificial ingredients or sweeteners that i cant pronounce  this cereal also fills me up for most of the morning unlike many high carb oversweetened cereals and most importantly it actually tastes good  the flavor sort of reminds me of cracker jack  crunchy and slightly caramelly  i like to add blueberries or dried cranberries to it for a little extra sweetness  its also great in yogurt  my only complaint is that some of the clusters in the cereal are really large so much so that i have to break them up before eating  a minor complaint really  overall i highly recommend go lean crunch', 'when i had a blockage in my heart 7 years ago one

first encounter with these darling little treats was while watching everyday italian on the food network starring giada de laurentiis my favorite chef of the past few years she crumbled them into deserts coffees made pumpkin ravioli with it baked amaretti apples and always praised their magical taste upon finally purchasing a box myself i was blown away by the hypnotic and addictive taste of marzipan in these little gems  amaretti cookies are packed as a pair wrapped in wax paper with italian writing and insignias praising its originality they are two small crackling cookies per wrapper and they are a crunchy shell of delight the taste is strangely addictive after having a few i couldnt stop thinking about them i have even purchased three more boxes two days after getting the first one they taste like the holidays spicy and lusciously laden with almonds and crispy sugary goodness with a tiny tang of bitterness of the almond they flavor is royal and time stopping on busy days one bite of this cookie and i am transfixed into magical fields of luxurious old world taste that has been popular to italians for years  incredibly aromatic crispy almond cookies that are a luscious addiction to coffee tea or wine and are great for cooking and baking with they really grew on me i think i am an addict to their taste now no wonder giada is so smitten with them   kasia s', 'very

a breakfast cereal and was also disappointed that there arent as may clusters as i would have expected  it seems like most of the clusters in my bag fell apart and i was left with loose oats and flax seed  i tended to eat this as a breakfast cereal and got about four average bowls out of one bag  overall i suppose its healthier for me and wasnt too bad to munch on in the morning  i did put a bit

it by a friend and was unaware of its medicinal properties so was my friend fyi  within 15 minutes i was starting to get paranoid and less socially apt and started to feel distant from everything

effects did go away within about 5 hours  this was after drinking only a quarter of a mug of it  these are actually the same reactions i had to two different varieties of the birth control pill  so if youve reacted badly to birth control be warned that you may also react badly to this tea  or you may be lucky in that it will not affect you  take care if you do try it and good luck', 'these would be

people will like pamelas gluten free bread mix  i did too but do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix  9 grams per slice based on their stated 16 slices per loaf  this is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener  as you know thats 15 tablespoons in the mix approximately so compare that to your favorite recipes  i see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes  i cant think of any reason they are doing this except for taste  to make it more sellable  just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up  ', 'all

went to dinner at a moroccan restaurant and has the most delicious fruit salad there  what made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in  i bought this product to recreate the dish and love it  i also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk along with cardamom to make an authentic north africanstyle coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe  granted orange blossom water is and acquired taste and i would not recommend tasting it by itself  it is much better served in small portions mixed with fruits nuts coffees teas and pastries  a superb product', 'my first experience with gf cookies  giving up the regular cookies breads and pastas i love has been challenging to say the least  i purchased these cookies based on other reviews and im glad i did  the taste flavor and texture of these cookies is very good  it was a bit disappointing that most of the cookies had broken but i understand thats pretty common for gf baked goods especially when they have to be shipped  nonetheless they were good enough that none of the crumbles were wasted  i just sprinkled them on top of vanilla ice cream and that was even better  i most likely will order these again  the package arrived quickly and in good shape with the cookies securely wrapped in plastic wrap over the papertype cookie container', 'i have been buying these from my local grocery store for a while now and was very happy to see the wisecrackers available on amazon at about 40 below the grocery store prices and with free delivery cannot beat that aside from the price why do i buy wisecrackers  1 texture and crunch they are much tougher then regular crackers they hold much better when you need them for a dip or a base for a topping they allow you to feel the crunch and take a loooong time before getting soggy when covered with a topping  2 taste they taste almost like bread crust with only 110 calories and 2g of fat for ten good sized crackers each is about two inches by two inches  regarding the flavour i like the sesame variety the most for their neutral aftertaste the pepper variety is not as versitile in fact it is quite spicy you will have to choose the dips and the toppings carefully however they can be eaten alone as well as a light inbetweenmeal snack  enjoy', 'i use a lot of garlic when i cook so this was a very convenient item to keep stocked in my pantry  my only complaints are as follows  a the jars reek of garlic even though they werent leaking i inspected them all very well in fact even the box they were shipped in stank to high heaven like garlic so i had to ziplock bag the jars before i put them in the pantry which solved that conundrum  b this chopped garlic has metabisulfite in it and if you have a sulfite sensitivity this is definitely not the product for you  c im not a big fan of soy oil and this product uses soy oil as the oil in this garlic  regarding the consistency of this productthis is partially a paste with chunks of chopped garlic so its more of a mix of paste and chopped garlic rather than just chopped garlic you definitely need to give it a good stir before you refrigerate it after opening because the oil floats to the top of the jar  the flavor is excellent and worked great in my ginger/lemon/garlic/pepper/honey/mustard/tarragon salad dressing it cooks up fine as long as you add it after some other food is already in the pan veggies or meat etc because this will pop and splatter especially at high cooking temps it worked great in my italian meatballs and mixed with butter and paprika on my garlic bread  bonus the jars are super cute and ill be keeping them and reusing them for other things', 'i think i have purchased every

boxes together amazon did offer refund but now the price is much higher   might as well go to the store and get it now same price but i will show some loyalty and order once morefingers crossed', 'i enjoy many of amys organic products so when i purchased this i assumed id like it  i had planned to use this as a base and later add in more ingredients but after opening the can emptying it into a pot to shimmer and sampling it i changed my mind ick the grated tofu i assume it is the tofu adding the grittiness to the chili anyway is very unpleasant it didnt taste like tofu or anything really it just felt tough and like plastic the texture it added was not enjoyable at all  the flavor wasnt anything to rave about either it was alright but i couldnt get past how gross that grit was so i wasnt able to eat much of it  in the future i wont take short cuts ill just make my own chili from scratch', 'good dog biscuit  it is the treat she gets when we have to leave her home alone for a little

treats', 'easy to use and good flavor this product is a fine white powder with clearly visible sugar crystals that mixes very easily with the espresso and frothed milk for our white chocolate mochas product has a good flavor when mixed according to directions not too sweet be aware this is a flavored powder probably not white chocolate at all because it contains no cocoa butter which i believe is used to make white chocolate white chocolate isnt chocolate at all the first three ingredients of this product are sugar partially hydrogenated coconut oil and corn syrup solids you decide whether the price for this is a good value or whether this is really a white chocolate product or as the label states sweet ground white chocolate followed by the very important word in smaller print flavor we will continue to search for the perfect white chocolate flavoring for our mochas but we are pleased with this one', 'i have been giving these to my dogs for the past couple of years  they love them

mostly for the level of spice then pepper flavor good crunch and not loaded down with salt  with that said these deep river snacks chips jalapeno flavor are 1 better than the lays jalapeno  deep river have the same spice level which is lacking  neither have a lot of pepper flavor 2 about the same as the jalapeno chips that the world market branded chips  world market has a little more spice but also a lot more salt 3 not nearly as good as tims cascade jalapeno chips  tims has more pepper flavor more spice a little bit better crunchbut also have msg  its not to say these chips are bad but

way to cut down my calories on margaritas at home  actually i have only one margarita no more than three evenings a week but they are a treat  the difference in calories is about 5 for the crystal light versus 150 in most regular mixers so i thought it was worth a shot  i mixed up two quarts exactly as directed  the color comes out almost exactly the same as my regular margarita mix but from there the similarity ends  well speaking for myself this was absolutely the worst margarita i have had in my life  this mixer has a terrible aftertaste to the point that i didnt even want to finish the margarita  in my opinion you cannot compare this product to regular margarita mixes  id sooner cut my three margaritas a week down to just one to save the calories  ingredients from the container are  citric acid maltodextrin salt aspartame sweetener natural favor contains less than 2 of acesulfame potassium sweetener magnesium oxide artificial color yellow 5 blue 1  this product is gluten free  a couple of days later i gave this one more try just to see if it would be an okay drink without adding tequila  i also asked my husband if he would be interested in trying it  he took one look at the puce green color and said it reminded him of colyte  you have to be over 50 to know what this is  he is right i tried it straight and the taste is very similar  in any case the strong aftertaste is very much present  i couldnt finish a glass of this either', 'this was the first time i have ever seen kefir grains it was a cold minus 5c when the mail arrived and i thought that they

insulated picnic cooler well just wanted to say that this is fun and easy for this first timer to use and much cheaper than store bought and i know they are alive and fresh thanks any tips or

says but without any sweetness  the texture is not good  like frozen milk not creamy at all the chocolate peanut butter is a better flavor but still no sweetness  it tastes like chocolate with a hint

sweet tooth', 'i made my own baby food for my first child i would spend a whole day every few weeks cooking and pureeing foods in large batches to freeze but with my second i just didnt have the time

it is so much easier than when i did large batches my blender never got it fine enough it was kinda chunky and took a lot of work to use separate pots to boil and steam and then the blender there were a lot more things to wash the beaba is so easy to use and clean i highly recommend it for other busy mothers i wish i had it for my first child and i am finding ways to use it for my preschooler too i add some of the pureed or steamed veggies to her food since it is hard to get vegetables in her so i will be using this for a long time well worth the money', 'ordered this as a healthy snack and

mint chocolate chocolate rasberry amaretto and orange mocha  there are a few other flavors but i dont recommend them due to personnal tastes  in any event caffe dvita is a terrific alternative and

of the 34 oz boxes the seals were broke slightly  all 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly  very noticeable as i held onto them  the slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal two of the containers was smashed on the top  both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals when i opened some of the shipping packages of these products it smelled moldy  the seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged some of the seals were far too easy to remove  not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight  34

than others i drank them all anyway with no apparent ill affects except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken  3 of the 4 with broken seals i poured down the drain  the price of the 34 oz 6

would not choose it over some other brands i like', 'granted this coffee is not starbucks  then again if thats what youre expecting then you wont be happy  however this coffee is a great everyday coffee that tastes better than your standard folgers or maxwell house but provides a better value  for the amount of coffee you get 64 oz its a better deal than anything i can buy at sams club  the grind is a little more coarse than other ground drip coffees like folgers or maxwell house and could probably work in a french press if you dont mind a little extra sediment in your coffee  i was pleasantly surprised at the mellow taste that wasnt weak and have been enjoying this coffee for about a week straight  i would definitely recommend this coffee to anyone who isnt expecting their coffee to taste like a kick in the facewhich by the way i do love starbucks in addition to more mellow brews', 'im addicted to salty and tangy flavors so when i opened my first bag of sea salt  vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable  as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer  kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosher  i also recommend <a href=http//wwwamazoncom/gp/product/b000g6mbv4>kettle chips honey dijon</a> and <a href=http//wwwamazoncom/gp/product/b000g6q4gm>kettle chips spicy thai</a>  annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly', 'this tea is a lifesaver during cold and flu season  the ginger helps with an upset stomach the lemon is uplifting and calming at the same time and when you add some honey its a great sore throat soother  i love it and always keep some in my pantry  i havent tried it as an iced tea but its great hot', 'i read the ingredients and thought these would be a delicious healthy snack but they are just plain bland  they are crispy and fresh but there is very little flavor to them  i was sincerely disappointed  im just glad i bought them on sale or i would be angry as well as saddened by the lack of cheese flavor  if you are looking for an expensive crunch without tongue tingling taste these are for you  i can not recommend them  i will not be buying these

that cooks when i get home from work so i have no expertise other than what i have learned over the years feeding kids  however once i started using demi glace to make sauces with chicken pork and beef it brought a flavor to meals that i only had when dining out at more expensive places  i love the roasted chicken and the de viande gold for just about everything i cook  my wife loves my sauces just for dipping bread i seldom ever see a bad review for any demi glace product and if there is a bad review i believe the person using it just doesnt take the time to learn how to cook with it  the

the fridge it will last up to 6 months', 'if you like your popped corn small this is for you taste is good and it is crisp yet tender the only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of

all 4 bottles i ordered  everybody else wanted to charge shipping per bottle', 'i am an earl grey fan and i am currently enjoying a thermos of stashs double bergamot as we speak the citrus background of the standard earl grey mix is definitely amped up making it into the central focus of the tea as opposed to the black tea base it is obvious you are still drinking tea mind you but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin  cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out making it by the traditional full pot method of 1 per person and 1 per pot and for me often 1 extra just for the fun of it makes the taste borderline spicy this is how i first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because i knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength i recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness  like lapsang souchong this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long days hike it gives me a little extra perk at work and i like that  however i cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker i like having tea socially and sharing it with my friends most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly just like the aforementioned lapsang souchong  earl grey fans however can rest assured that it is a five star review for them', 'to our taste these chocolates are on a par with far more expensive ones in glittery

decided to try the original flavor after trying my first bag i have a few comments 1 great service  i ordered them on 1/27 and they were delivered on 2/3 with no damage to the packaging 2 i like the 24pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control 3 as a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like pringles  whether thats good or bad is up to individual tastes 4 the nutritional information isnt terrible a serving has 100 calories 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat and only 160 mgsodium pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories 180 mg sodium and 10 grams fat and pretzels with 110 calories 450 mg sodium and 1 gram fat 5 they are kind of dry and bland but are delicious with salsa  i really liked them with costcos peach mango salsa i dont have cottage cheese in the house so i couldnt try that and i think peanut butter wouldnt be good unless something wet like sugarfree jam or jelly is also added i just got them so im not sure if ill reorder another box i think im going to next order amazons 6flavor variety pack 4 original potato 4 bbq 4 salt  pepper 4 sea salt  vinegar 4 sour cream  onion 4 cheddarbefore deciding i would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste im giving 4 stars because i really

changes they made a couple of years ago to this product  the texture and quality are different and the packaging has changed and not for the better this was our familys favorite graham cracker they told me they changed production and there was no going back to the old way  too bad they lost a customer also the last case i received went rancid before the expiration date  i store these in my pantry which is cool and dry  not sure why that happened but it was a waste they also arrive very cracked and broken due to the way they are packaged i wont be buying these anymore', 'this is a wonderful snack even if these snapeas are quite addictive even my five year old granddaughter eats these when she wont eat any other vegetables', 'not as smooth a taste as i expected  not comparable to tullys house blend bought at a tullys coffee shop in seattle', 'i was worried about ordering such a large bag without ever having tried this brand before  it turned out i worried for nothing  its a tasty coffee at a fantastic price and im happy to recommend it  if youre a true coffee snob this might fall slightly short but it ranks up there with the rest of the whole bean coffees available at my grocery store  the only time ive tasted better was at one of those high end coffee shops with artisan beans', 'i immediately loved the bold smoky savory taste of this mate  the smokiness was almost peaty like youd find in a scotch whisky and the taste of the wood it was matured in comes on strong too also like a well aged scotch definitely more flavorful than the regular release rosamonte ive bought several times before  but i discovered the hard way that its much stronger in its effects than other brands of mate ive tried its easy to overdose if youre already used to other brands to put it in perspective ive never experienced any symptoms of excess from mate no matter how much i used  it could be a varietal theyre using or simply that this stuff is fresher and more effectively

vary from person to person and i am not partial to any one brand i just didnt find this particular coffee to have any standout aspects  it tasted fine and i have no complaints  i will say i did not find myself shaking from a caffeine letdown later after drinking it so thankfully its not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees ive tried  i realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine but i wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip  unlike other reviewers i did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug  i simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water  i had rich dark coffee with very little fuss', 'i enjoyed this product and have purchased several bags

up izze sparkling juice and can honestly say i really liked it it is carbonated is sparkling which sets it apart from most other juices  at first i wasnt completely taken with the carbonation/sparkling aspect for one thing it seemed particularily carbonated i mean  wow bubbly once you get passed the inital surprise with a sparkling juice the flavor really takes over  surprisingly the ingredients listed in order are  white grape apple and lemon juice  i guess its the white grape and lemon that give this drink its little kick of flavor which pushes it beyond your average apple juice  because there is no extra refined sugar added the calorie and sugar gram count come in below very fine which is a good thing and importantly taste is not sacrificed  on a side note and really kind of cool the izze company is very ecofriendly their offices are powered by the wind they do the bike to work thing and support recycling efforts its nice to see a company giving

salty taste but lots of flavor', 'well the sauce is not the hottest thing in the world but it is fairly hot however the taste is garbage it is reminiscent of bbq sauce however the rest tastes like

reviews to products i cooked this up last night into a horrible mush  first of all the cooking directions are vague at best so i just cooked it the way one normally cooks pasta only i cooked it for a

sure how to cook it or what to do with it it has some earthy flavor to it something between seaweed and yerba mate it is about 60 less than quinoa so popping it like a pop corn did not work cooking it was rather easy but direction recommends way too much water to use you might end up with some sort of gravy  bottom line it is interesting alternative to quinoa that mixes well with milk or can be

artichoke dip on crackers  both times the dish was excellent  it would also be good with scrambled eggs anything in which you would want and preflaked consistency to your salmon  not too salty not too oily feels very nourishing yum  i point out the consistency because i was hoping this would be more of a trailside snack/ fingerfood kind of thing based on the tags reviewers had given it  it is not jerky  it definitely needs to be eaten with a utensil  if you had no utensil you could eat it with chips/crackers if you had a bowl in which to dip it or a tortilla and you can pour it onto the tortilla its very good on both  but i would only eat it with my fingers if i was starving and desperate because it is not fingerfood consistency  so you know prepare to have a vector for this food

dictate which could be very much unlike the fda standards in america i also believe that amazoncom should stipulate where each product is made and not the double talk about  packaged in canada which could mean purchased in china and then packed in canada the only way to improve our country is to rely on americans to produce products receive the rewards of their labors and stabilize the economynow

it in a glass stirring with a spoon and it dissolved quickly for me  i found it to be quite strong even with added ice and ended up adding more cold water to suit my taste i thought the flavor was good  i could taste the honey blackberry and pomegranate flavors but found it was a bit overly sweet and this comes from a confessed sugar junkie still i enjoyed it after adding the water and would choose it again  interestingly enough a serving is only 8 ounces though you mix each packet in a 16~oz bottle of water  i cant imagine what the purpose of making this distinction is other than to

a slight bitter taste to me but i still ate them i dont feel as guilty eating these since they are allnatural and with cabbage and carrots for coloring its almost like eating health food ', 'lets be honest right off the bat  yes they stink when you first open the bag  there i said it  but after you rinse them for about 1530 seconds then parboil them quickly that goes away  what youre left with is a noodle fit for soup or eat them with a little added sauce dont drown them or olive oil garlic and tomatoes theyre slurpy and they take on the flavors of whatever you add to them  great for those of trying to cut down on or abstain from regular pasta  these are high in fiber and have almost zero calories  yeah you heard me   unlike regular shitake noodles these do not need to be refrigerated until after the package is opened  these are a noodle lovers lowcarb eaters friend', 'these seed taste really good  i wish they were a little bigger if they were i would have given them a 5 rather than 4  enjoy', 'great product at a great price my dog has many food allergies and sensitivities so it is great to find such a healthy treat that he loves they were also a very good price', 'walkers shortbread stem ginger biscuits are just simply delicious they are filled with lots of pieces of ginger and the cookie is very rich and buttery tasting but not loaded with sugar i am so glad i discovered these biscuits', 'i have tried several raw cacao powders from different companies and this one was the worst when mixed with moisture it becomes like mud it was impossible to get a smooth dessert or cream using this powder and the flavor seems muted as though the intense chocolate flavor is missing it was also more expensive than the other brands i tried i wont order this product again very disappointed', 'this tastes good is fresh nicely package excellent priced but what i received i do not consider to be shreds  they are little tiny pieces more like flecks  i am not able to use these as i had intended', 'i noticed the other day that there was still one of these minicongo digestive support treats in my car so i guess max and ginger dont count it as a favorite your mileage may vary on that count on the other hand the ones they ate did seem to be easy on their digestion ginger was puking up almost everything she ate at the time but she had no trouble keeping these down i would say that they are worth a try especially if your dog doesnt do too well with rawhide or other traditional treats', 'i ordered this tea along with several other roland tea in tins  this was the worst of the lot  i was expecting something bursting with orangey goodness  i figured you can get constant comment at the store and its delicious  this should be even better  it wasnt  the orange flavor was completely undetectable  there were a scant few shriveled bits of orange peel but it wasnt enough to give this tea any discernible orange flavor  and spices  hah  no spice taste at all  the tea itself is fine black tea  just not orange spice', 'the most important thing to know about these bars is that they are filling  they could probably replace a meal for hungry eaters  i should also add that they are deliciousa nice blend of sweet and salty  think a pay day dipped in peanut butter and you are on the right track make no mistake these are pure junk food but they do provide a nice boost of energy  another convenient surprise is that they do not melt in the summer heat  these bars are the perfect in the car on the go or at the beach hunger catchall', 'we are really disappointed we tried different ways to get the food doneat first smaller pieces then more time steaming but none of them worked out even when you cut the food in very small pieces it takes forever to get  it done now we are back to the old way and it takes even less time than baby brezza too bad we spent a good amount of money in something that it does work', 'my dad got an assortment of these to give as a silly little christmas gift for us we are adults now  i really wasnt expecting much from them but i was pleasantly surprised  the flavors are mild but good tasting and not sickly sweet  similarly the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gutbusting feeling you get from drinking soda  i was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar or aspartame  the only drawback is the sodium content contained in the compounds that create the carbonation  one other thing to note is that one tablet is for 6 ounces of water so you will likely need to use 2 or 3 tablets for a normal glass or bottle of water  overall id say that if you are a soda drinker you will find these disappointing since the flavors and carbonation are mild  however as an alternative to crystal lite koolade which i cant stand or plain water these are fun and make a good drink', 'i just got done with the hcg diet so i was looking for a bar that was low in sugar i actually ate these in p3 and did not gain weight  i love coconut and i absolutely love these bars  i have tried all of them except the one with nuts and my favorite is the classic because i like that is has more chocolate  the macaroon one is good too but it only has chocolate on the bottom where the classic is totally covered with it  the mint is not my favorite  it is good but i am not a huge mint fan  people say they are like mounds but it is not  mounds are gooey  these are fairly dense in the inside but sweet and coconutty it really satisfies my cravings for sweet in a very healthy way  i love these bars the only downside is that they are pretty expensive  i would eat 2 a day if i could afford it', 'i love this butter its better than regular butter and makes eggs or anything else taste great plus its organic with higher levels of conjugated linoleic acid cla a must in every home i think', 'i found this herbal tea when visiting in western michigan after i made my first pitcher of iced tea with it i was totally hooked so worth having on hand love it', 'i was expecting this to be really low sugar like dark chocolate i was expecting some difference it seems like they kinda replaced sugars with sugar alcohols which gives you a small rise in blood glucose levels and it also says adds a negligible amount of sugar it tastes just like regular chocolate if you like to buy regular chocolate this product is great', 'i bought this as a christmas present thinking it would be a cool way to grow tomatos and jalapenos inside i got the salsa garden kit  one of the tomato plants didnt germinate  aerogarden was quick to send a replacement but it was too late to plant it  i ended up transplanting of the seedlings from the side that germinated to the other side  within a couple weeks the pump started rattling  i called in multiple times and never got to a live person  emails went unanswered  finally a couple weeks ago its the last week in march the pump started to make so much noise i thought the dishwasher was on  we finally got ahold of someone at aerogarden we left a message and they called us back a couple days later  they said theyd send a new pump  they also recommended that we switch from tap water to some sort of bottled water  the change to ro water did not help the plants if anything they really didnt like it  today the pump finally died  ive transplanted the plants to dirt where theyll likely die  we called ag again and they said that a pump had been sent and that they would send us another salsa garden kit  to make matters worse when i tried to pull the pump out following the directions in the manual i was cleaning out the basin so it wouldnt stink the pump cover broke  ugh  now im using the grow light to help sprout some new seeds to plant outside in my garden  at 150 it is a heck of an expensive grow lamp  harvest  well there are about 2 dozen green tomatos and a few ripening ones  weve only got one pepper thats growing  color me disappointed', 'about 40 packets had no sugar in them and a bunch others were open and leaking the sugar grains were clumpy and in some packets stuck into a square mass the product seemed old and not freshly packed as i have noticed the fair trade packets to be in for example the local starbucks locations the product is not returnable hence a total waste of the 30 since our aim was to have received a fresh tasting and looking batch of sugar in packets to serve to our clients do not recommend to anybody would prefer our money back but there seems to be not way of requesting it through returns center not buying grocery items from amazon any more too risky', 'i dont know if its just me but this is the worst energy drink ive ever tried  it did nothing for me at all  granted i love coffee and energy drinks so i may have a bit of a tolerance but even my fiance who never drinks coffee and hates all red bulltype drinks drank a whole can and did not feel any boost at all  it seems like it works for some ppl but my experience was extremely disappointing  on the positive side the drinks taste good so at least it wasnt a complete waste of money just a really expensive can of soda   ', 'we found this recipe and wanted to try it this product was only available on amazon fast shipping product as described', 'i make my own enchilada sauce usually but if im pressed for time i go with the el pato for a canned sauce its pretty darn good', 'it is okay i bought it for my malteseshih tzu mix and he loves it my other dog is a beagle and he loves them too and gets jealous of my maltese mix the only thing i dont like about the product is that you have to feed 4 little packs a day per 10 lb dog the box i have is a 24 pack so you have to have to buy a big box every week  another thing i didnt like about this is there are a lot of by products in the food', 'yo soy corredora y he probado muchos tipos de productos este es el que mejor resultado me ha dado', 'i bought the greenpowder green tea and tastes great the jasmine also has a great taste and aroma  unfortunately amazon has increased its price close to 20 in a about a month i dont imagine the tea having increased

here <a href=http//wwwamazoncom/gp/product/b003mwbfxy>hills science diet adult sensitive stomach dry cat food  155pound bag</a> which is the same food as this but in a larger bag  here i just wanted to point out that this smaller size bag is actually much more expensive  as of the date im writing this this 35pound bag costs 371 per pound whereas the 7pound bag costs 350 per pound and the 155pound bag costs 232 per pound  so you pay over 50 more per pound for this size compared with the largest size  just wanted to point this out in case it could save anyone money  i like the cat food a lot', 'maybe we got a bad batch i dont know but these taste nothing like the full size packaged pringles  they are thinner much thinner and oily tasting  my kids turned their nose up at these and they love regular pringles  theyre not horrible just not good  no one in the family liked them  wont buy again', 'my dogs beg for these treats every night after dinner  i always make sure i have plenty of supply at hand', 'while i didnt like this flavor as well as the black cherry it was still quite good  had a nice fruity taste and not overly sweet probably because there is no added sugar  you wont miss the sugar and neither will your kids  this is a good alternative to regular soda for the kids because it doesnt have all the additives that soda does  its basically carbonated fruit juice  its 100 juice so you get a nice dose of vitamin c 100 daily allowance according to the can  adults will enjoy it too  the can is 83 oz which is smaller than a 12oz soft drink but it is just enough to satisfy your soda craving without filling you or your kids up too much  sugar is sugar whether naturally occurring in juice or added so these are not health drinks but are great alternatives to the much more sugar and additive laden sodas', 'the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately im unable to review the flavor as i forgot i cant have beef anymore due to health issues

world god wants us to tell everyone about his good news  its so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the bible predicts i am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if i am not ashamed of yahweh god and his messiah yahushua hamashiach jesus christ i do not forward those emails cuz i dont trust them im not computer literate either so i am sending this to everyone on my list along with everyone else as god does command us no matter what the consequence to us to share his good news with every one of his messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world  yep just like it says its going to happen in the holy bible no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed its gonna get beyond tragically ugly here if we think that theres been bad stuff already happening we aint seen nothin yet pretty much if i remember correctly but its in the bible god unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again remember sodom and gomorrah noahs ark and the great flood etc etc god abhors sin of which we are all guilty no matter how big or how small even the little white lie sin is sin to god and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from god  the bible also tells of the mark of the beast that the coming world leader the antichrist will force everyone to take either on their right hand or forehead if you dont take the mark you will die the thing about that is that we are all going to die if you take the mark though you will be damned eternally to hell and without god  the good news is that god loves us so much that he provided a way for us to be with him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins for those who choose to believe repent turn back to god receive and follow his command not request to accept his only holy blood covering for our sins yahushua ha mashiach jesus the christ we will be allowed to join him in the new heaven and new earth that god says he will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction  whether we believe in god or not heaven and hell or not we all believe that we are all going to die just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we cant see the air along with if we jump off a tall building we will fall cuz of gravity which we also cant see etc etc  the question is will we die only once with and for god if we repented received and followed the sin covering that god provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of his messiah yahushua who beat death and hell when he rose again and thus through his shed blood covering our sins we will be able to enter into heaven with god forever  is our choice instead to reject gods messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the beast from the antichrist thats coming or already here that will lead this war against israel god says that we cannot serve two masters that we have to choose to live and die once for him or live and die forever without him its just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of god  gods word whether we choose to believe is real like him or not and which has been proven true and continues to do so i believe is as true as it was yesterday is today and will be forever just like him with his swift terrible justice and his immeasurable love for us all because he provided our eticket to heaven the sacrificed and risen yahushua the messiah will you die with god or without him will you die for him or against him will you accept the bail yahushua hamashiach that he paid on your behalf to get out of satans hell so that you can enter into his heaven  my prayer is that all will ask jesus christ yeshua or yahushua the messiah into their heart and follow him so that all may know gods plan for our eternal salvation rescue from our sins and eternal separation from god in hell through his perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins yahushua and know his boundless unconditional love light ultimate peace power strength comfort mercy grace beauty healing hope joy and blessings for you are so very precious in his sight  its gods way that he says in his holy word is only through his holy son yahushua or the highway straight to hell may god have mercy on us all on our way to finding or rejecting and then serving him  jesus is my hope in life and my life in death  please take very good care shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of jesus christ  yahushua loves you', 'this is one of the first coconut oils i purchased  i purchased it for my homemade hair and body butter concoctions  it was/is a great product however i have found a cheaper alternative  thanks', 'these sardines are top quality they are small beautifully packed with a nice light smokey flavor the olive oil packing liquid adds nicely to the flavor its certainly worth the premium price', 'i bought mine at whole foods and was excited at first but no where on the package does it say that these colors do not work on eggs  okay so reading their website it says these are not for eggs fine no more easter eggs but what about coloring hard boiled eggs for kids bentos  nope the colors do not stick to a peeled egg either  and it did not matter how much vinegar i used either  okay so moving on to frosting no matter how much you add the frosting is always pastel okay fine no real biggie but the red comes out like a brick red color really quite orangish and i couldnt get a good a pink or purple because of it  i guess i should have put the stuff in the fridge because it does not last well either  i will definitely be looking for an alternative naturally colored food coloring until then i am relegated to nothing more than using the blue to make the kids scrambled eggs green a la seuss', 'i purchase this popcorn at costco every chance i get  i was glad to see it at amazon for such a great price  this popcorn is always very good and fresh the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because my favorite cheese popcorn is a little more cheesy and stickier', 'although slightly more expensive per pound than the same brand from costco approximately a 12 pound pack vs 1 pound for same price these have very little odor while same brand at costco are very aromatic  our golden retriever likes both about equally

trouble alone i dont know how to make a cup of good strong coffee using these teabag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine  i find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak  i have tried using these like actual teabags which definitely makes a better cup of coffee but requires a little more time and supervision than i want  i presume that the right kind of machine or the right style of coffeemaking turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use for me though not so much  but yeah seriously tasty coffee once you get the right amount of coffeeness in your hot water', 'this is one of our favorites for a mild coffee  its very flavorful but not strong or bitter and complements food very well', 'i love this coffee  its strong and bold without a bitter aftertaste  i have just placed an order for another one', 'worked ok kind of a pain to keep squirting it over and over thinking an aerosol would have been better', 'my wife and i go through jalapeno slices like theyre water we eat a lot of nachos and also include these in most everything else we cook

care for  i will not be buying it again because of that  perhaps a scentfree shampoo could be developed', 'this coconut oil is wonderful  i use it as the shortening in my bran muffins and then as a

for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge because of this i sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company there are always at least a few kinds in there ones that ive tried before and like and ones that im trying out for the first time i finally got around to trying kind bars after all this time and this specific flavor is officially on my thats it youve found a gold medal winner list  theres usually something for my picky side to take issue with but not this time i love that they have extra protein as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if i end up turning to one in place of lunch the fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that i would find it too crunchy but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasingbutnotoverpowering crunch unlike their sister bars passion fruit macadamia  b complex which i purchased at the same time these are not cloyingly sweet dont get me wrong they have sweetness but i find that its just the right amount youre tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along  i bought one box to try them out now im back to load up on them while they are on sale im going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety if you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix i really cant recommend this specific bar more', 'my wife is chinese and drinks this

initiate more than a few fans last year my local store stopped carrying wrights but brought in 3 new brands to replace it all three brands had soy in them and other various ingredients having only used wrights in the past i was shocked to learn that not all liquid smokes are created equal wrights liquid smoke is allergenfree which in my family is hugely important i was delighted to find wrights

everyone that i give a tea bag to  wants to buy it  it is perfect by itself or with cream  it has just a hint of cocoa  i found it to be more for coconut lovers than chocolate lovers  although my sister in law who is a chocolate nut loved this tea  hopefully amazon will carry this soon because the coffee shop is gone and i am running low', 'i ordered this to serve at the holidays and it was very well received  it does not have a strong coffee taste  its more of a cocoa flavor with a hint of coffee  the instructions on this product instruct to make it with water but it has a much richer taste if you make it with milk  at any rate its a good product and i would recommend it', 'item tasted plain and was crumbly did not taste at all like it is described we were disappointed with

will order more in the future', 'pomegranate my first sip of izzes sparkling pomegranate was not appreciated by my palate very much i thought it tasted like someone had mixed a wine cooler with beer i actually did a double take to look at the can and search for alcohol content by the end of the can i liked it and by the 3rd can i really liked it its tangy fresh with no sweet aftertaste and has a cool looking container design aesthetics always matter  with a total of 80 calories per cute little can this isnt exactly what youd call a diet drink but i find it to be surprisingly filling so it makes a great inbetween liquid snack and can stave away the hunger pangs until your next meal without doing damage to your diet  overall a nifty drink in a most attractive can dont let the first taste fool you izzes pomegranate fizzy is quite yummya very pleasurable acquired taste  grapefruit izzes sparkling grapefruit is absolutely the best drink in a can i have ever tasted nothing is even a close 2nd tangy and refreshing its lemony grapefruit flavor is quite strong and tantalizing it also contains white grape apple and orange juice from concentrates but what my taste buds remember most is the lemon and grapefruit the grapefruit flavor has 90 calories per can for those counting calories but like the pomegranate its very filling and does well as an inbetween snack for dieters  this wonderful izze fizzy is addictive on a hot day cold sparkling grapefruit is a total delight and since it does not have refined sugars it truly takes away your thirst not like those soda pop drinks that actually seem to make one thirstier thank you izze your sparkling grapefruit gets the gold award for canned beverage in my house if youre into hard likker izzes grapefruit would make the perfect mixer for

love these one of my dogs has a very sensitive stomach too but has never had any issues with these theyre crunchy lowodor treats that make a great little snack theyre too big to use as a treat if youre going to be handing out multiple treats for a training session though and attempting to cut them will crack the outer crunchy shell  in addition to the treats themselves i love the 40 oz plastic jar it keeps them fresh and is reusable i once bought a box of these in the store that some creepy crawlies had gotten into so i love that the plastic jar keeps the bugs out too', 'for the most part these are what youd want in pistachios they arrive fresh and tasty for a little lower price than the local store  id estimate about 510 of the nuts are not opened and get trashed another 10 get opened with some fingernail prying and pulling pretty hard  theyre pretty salty which isnt ideal but right where id expect a normal salted pistachio great for some who like salty and too much for others  however theres one bug in the product  literally i think two of the last three bage had one nut each where the nut had a bug  work whatever it was  inside the shell  if youre on the couch munching watching tv not looking at the nuts you open and eat itd be very easy to have eaten it its disgusting  i contacted the manufacturer and they explained they try but its not practical to avoid theyre

completely different flavors of teas arrived the flavors look gross strawberry lemonade and other fruity flavors but none of the teas they claim are included are herethis not what i ordered customer service leaves something to be desired in my opinion they should have put a rush order on the teas they forgot to send me now i have tea i paid for and dont want very disappointed', 'it is good i prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch but for store bought its pretty good much cheaper in local grocery stores under 5 per box at my local stores in chicagoland area', 'i dont do very many reviews of products but i had to for this to try and spare others like me this is one of the most repulsive vile and sickening food products i have ever had i know nothing about their other flavors but stay very far away from this it tastes like someone took whiteboard chalk ground it up put it into a kiln with coffee bean shells and roasted them together until they were burned beyond recognition i cant find the words to describe the awfulness of this product so ill try a different method to describe it some of you may be looking at these bars because they are vegan if you are trust me you will be happier eating a slab of baby seal which you clubbed yourself while kicking puppies in the face i truly wish there was a negative star rating this product deserves it', 'i love this salt hardly have to use any its very salty thank goodness its healthy  i never use table salt or sea salt anymore', 'my honest opinion beautiful but strange tasting and made me feel a little sick they tasted good enough so that i ate five more quickly after eating the first and did notice a melon flavor but it seemed quickly muted by this odd sweet taste that made me feel ill it wasnt highly unpleasant but made it taste what i thought was overly candy like and so turned what could have tasted like something pleasant into a cheap candy taste that was too strong and so made me feel sick also the powdery consistency in the middle i dont think was strong enough i noticed more of the soft outer covering than the filling which was more interesting and so wanted to taste that more but it was so easy to chew that it passed into me fast and was gone in a moment', 'the regular cola flavor has a terrible diet taste  i hate artificial sweeteners just cant get used to the chemical taste i just plain dont like it at all and poured the rest of the syrup down the drain after using only enough for 1 bottle of soda  yep its that bad', 'i like all of the flavors to a degree except this one

bad case of diarrhea he stopped eating and drinking for a day  i was so worried about the lil guy after an overnight stay  a very expensive vet bill my lil bully returned home full of energy  the vet recommened that he would have to eat canned purina en for the rest of his life  realizing that they really just wanted my money i decided to switch his food  i decided to go with canadae als during the transition blackjack was still having a loose stool after more research i finally decided on cal natural lamb  rice i started mixing this food and bj developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case  i started the at home remedy of pepto bismol and a bland diet  the pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well  bj fasted for 24 hours  after feeding him boiled chicken  rice for a few days the blood gradually disappeared i slowly started mixing the cal natural lamb  rice all i can say is bj is feeling 100 better and his stool is solid  this was the result i wanted with wellness but i

easily i mean my 35 month old wheaten terrier destroyed these in less than 30min and shes only about 15 pounds right now they are recommended for dogs 6 months  with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris for my dog this was bs she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested and managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur the mess wasnt an issue the durability was this is basically an expensive treat i much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat and they last

stocked at home but we only have them about once a month when velveeta came out with their version we gave it a try im not a fan of other velveeta products but my wife is this product however has won me over its better then hamburger helper in just about every way first it cooks much easier hamburger helper has a powdered cheese mix that gets clumpy and has to be rigorously stirred in order to mixed properly i found the easiest way is to heat the cheese water and milk in a separate pot then add it as a mixture when its time this not only reduces heating time but makes it easier to mix velveetas cheesy skillets doesnt have that problem the cheese is not powdered so it mixes in without any trouble theres an additional seasoning packet that is powder but takes no effort to mix it in so cookingwise velveeta wins easily  as far as taste velveeta is far better the seasoning adds a lot more flavor and when we went back to hamburger helper to finish off the last box we found it almost bland in comparison velveeta is a bit more expensive but the price is well worth it we havent bought hamburger helper since of course this is not exactly the healthiest meal but when your time is limited and you need a bailout for dinner id recommend velveeta', 'these do not work dont waste your money i recently purchased three boxes each holding two moth traps a month ago i put all six all

the last thing i noticed as the smokey smell stuck to my fingers until i washed it off  the treats are flexible rectangles that look like beef jerky  about 3/4 wide and 15 long  my dog loved them and showed off his best manners as he waited hopefully for an extra treat so they must taste pretty good  if you are working out cost per dog treat my 4 oz bag had 37 treats inside  as a premium dog treat this seems to be about an average cost but well probably stick with a cookie/biscuit type of treat around here because of the odor cost and kongability but might buy these occasionally as a special treat  pros  flavor really appealed to my dog  feels/appears/smells to be a premium/special dog treat  cons  odor  cant hide a pill in these  not smushable  flexible so it doesnt work in a kong and probably not in a planet pet or other dog toys that dispense treats', 'vita coco  the most repulsive tasting coconut water on the market  i wont be buying them again i have had the plain flavor', ' then these are for you a lil too sour for me  im more of a date guy  but worth a try a short list of simple ingredients', ' tazos china green tips green tea is a slightly stronger green tea than tazos zen and i liked that it doesnt contain tazos omnipresent natural flavors that almost all of their other teas contain which to me is not an advantage i like a natural real taste with real ingredients sans vague natural flavors and sans flavorings sans essences etc china green tips delivers this in a cleaner purer way than tazos other teas i liked this green tea  the ingredients in china green tips are simply springharvested green teas from china it contains caffeine  tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zentype focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teasthis wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea china green tips has none of these natural flavors and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience  on the paper tea packet tazo writes a traditional chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor this is the perfect way to describe this tea on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of china green tips as grassy vegetative sweet ricey tazo describes the aroma as vegetative popcorn  i would rate this tea and tazo in general as very goodbetter than premium teas like stash or celestial seasoningsbut not as good as numi or aspen still this tea is excellent so im breaking my tradition with tazo teas and giving it five stars if you enjoy super premium teas and are stuck with tazo for some reason choose china green tips and you will be quite satisfied i cant honestly say that about any other tazo tea ', 'just wanted to warn any potential buyers that i received an open package buying from amazon llc  i think thats pretty disgusting since this is a product thats intended for

seem to do its job without the rush like some other energy drinks will give you thats a major bonus for me as i really dont like that rush overall its a great product and im glad i got to test it out

saying that i love how sweet all of these treats taste dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies plus the ingredients are very straight forward they are probably healthier than most the stuff mom eats but there in lies the problem dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age the second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar as we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar and just like humans can develop diabetes  conclusion your puppy is nearly guaranteed to love the taste however these should only be used as an occasional treat if you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day they would soon plump up if you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly you may want to think twice on the pro side they are all natural with no animal biproducts 3 out of 4 paws because dad made me if we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4', 'the pasta and sauce are separately

with actual meat in it or at least something that resembles meat closely enough  it has a small amount of spice to it  this isnt something i would serve to small children just larger kids and grown ups  the drawbacks to this dish are that the pasta is coated with a bit of oil that i was unable to avoid  once done i felt like i needed to wash my hands  i think it was mostly from the draining step  finally there are two plastic containers included in this  one of them does have a reusable plastic top but it has holes in it  i suppose you could tape up the holes or use it store things you might want to air a bit like cheese  otherwise you are tossing a good bit of plastic  both containers are marked 5 recyclable so perhaps you can recycle them where you live', 'my two maltese really like these treats i like the extra fresh flavor much better both of my dogs have really bad dental issues i brush them every day but i also give them a dental bone every day the nutri dents have gone in their regular rotation my dogs are pretty small romeo is about 11 pounds and juliet is roughly 9 pounds they used to be given these mini ones but because they are pretty aggressive chewers i now give them the medium version after some trial and error as these mini ones were devoured too quickly these treats arent super soft but they are relatively soft when compared to other harder dental treats we have tried these have a really similar texture to the greenies brand but we like these ones much better than the greenies these treats smell pretty gross to me but my pups love them i like the smell of the extra fresh ones they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor i like that these are gluten free i like that they have added vitamins and omegas these ones are okay nutritionally for a treat and the chewing action is always a good thing but i like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health most importantly my dogs love the taste of both of the treats i buy these ones rarely as i much prefer the other flavor but these are still good treats the only negatives i have are that these are really pricey and they are devoured quite quickly even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth they are still much better than many other treat brands out there and

costco carries this and they havent had my favorite tullys kona for a while it lives up to the light roast description and brews one of the lightest you might also say weakest cups of coffee ive had in any kcup even using two kcups didnt help much its way too light for my tastes glad i didnt buy the box of 88 at costco  so if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee youd like this the flavor is good but kcups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me  amazon did ship fast and had a good price  update some reviews here dont seem to understand the terms being used  light roast is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor  it does produce a `lighter cup of coffee  extra bold is a term keurig/green mountain uses to describe a kcup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal kcups  more coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee the strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew  you can have a light roast coffee in an extra bold kcup but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor  personally i like a medium roast a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite', 'seriously

matter how much mayo you mix it with it still tastes just a bit like spicy vomit  two stars only because i feel bad faulting the product based on someone elses recommended use for it im sure theres a better use for it and at least now i have two and a half bottles left over to experiment with though im not looking forward to it just dont buy it expecting subway sauce or you may be as disappointed

like most people prefers smooth texture does not like it even when paired with syrup  he does like it better when pairing the waffle with a much stronger sweetener  buckwheat honey which also gives the end product a nutty flavor  my son who is 7 does not like it either because of the visible dark grains in the waffle  he thinks its dirty  my 4yearold daughter does not seem to mind it when paired with syrup  that said this is an honest product with all natural ingredients and definitely not one of those foodlike products with smooth texture to lure you but are bad for your health in the long run  this is how waffles were supposed to come out 100 years ago when steel mills were not around and people were eating stone ground grains and living a much healthier life style  you cant beat 7g

managers of tazo  tea like coffee is about all about freshness the china green tips tazo supplies to starbucks is fresh whole leaves the tea in these bags is stale crumbs and a real dissapointment  i

chance to experience how really good green tea can be rather they are told that green is good for you and if you just flavor it right it should be drinkable there are shops through out america with

popcorn it tasted really good i used about a tablespoon of seasoning for one bowl of popcorn i think that was a little on the light side probably 15  tablespoons would have been better but thats a matter of taste use less flavoring than you think you want and just add more if necessary  my husband also used this on some potatoes and i think it would blend nicely with sour cream or yogurt for a good dip so its versatile the price seems a little steep but a little of the seasoning goes a long way based on my experience with this flavor im going to try some of the other paragon seasonings  oh

cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight at which point the icing was still wet  after putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg f and cooling them the icing was less wet but still tacky and not ready for bagging  i have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry  it wouldve been helpful to see this noted on the packaging  i would not

completely come to a stop  from something that was getting to be every 2030 min to now it does it about 23 times a day much less noticable too the twitching isnt as severe or bothersome  so i would have given this 5 stars but i am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems ive noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies  those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms  i am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up and see if it gets any better with other things  but i think its great for just helping with my eye it

up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months i finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain i still cant figure out why they added caramel color when

tots by happy baby one of my favorite brands the price was not that great  i later found it for substantially less 2 less at a local organic market  as to taste while ive tried all other flavors and

box for free i probably wouldnt have bought it there are too many cereals i like to bother with one i might or might not like right  my concerns were twofold first would they be sweet enough i dont need sugarcoated cereal but i dont want to eat cardboard either and second tightwoven cereals like this tend to suckup all the milk so theyll start off too dry but end up too soggy could this cereal overcome those concerns  in a word yes  the flavor was sweet with a hint of cinnamon the squares startedoff crunchy but not too rough and they did not suckup the milk like a sponge so they werent too soggy at the end either  i still have other cereals that i like better but ill likely occasionally buy this one too', 'this is a worcestershirebase mix and its quite good  hot but not too hot although

quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is not good but its not that bad either and its also not sweet at all but hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor overall though i do recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the natural taste so if your just after those health

leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes i did not time it but it was more than two minutes my son would not eat it i made myself a package it tastes kind of like macaroni with cheetos powder on it although i think cheetos powder would taste better i wound up melting a piece of organic american cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable i think im going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese this product was a big fail in my household this is the first

bite sized pieces that melt in your mouth and are chewy these are big pieces that will snap in half if you bend them i will not be purchasing these again its worth the extra cash to get the small bags

blending of this tea is excellentspearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor then you taste a hint of lemon the green tea

aftertaste  remember that this tea does have caffeinehowever it does not say how much on the box a good estimate might be 30 mgcompared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter four minutes is ample', 'i had always seen the commercials for these energy drinks and being the skeptic i am never really paid

feels like ive taken illicit drugs i have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful  i will note that some people seem to get nothing from these so before you go out and buy 24 bottles

with fairly low expectations  i figured it would be dry and crunchy throughout and bland  was i wrong  this stuff is great dry or in cereal  while the chocolate isnt creamy its definitely not hard and crunchy either  kelloggs hit a home run with this one and i hope to continue seeing it on store shelves', 'i thought this would be a lot like hamburger helper  boy was i wrong  because the cheese sauce isnt added until the very last step just before eating this is creamier and smoother than any variety of hamburger helper ive ever had and ive tries most of them  i suppose some people would think that the extra step waiting until the seasonings and pasta have already finished cooking before adding the cheese sauce make this more complicated  i dont think so and it is so worth that little

two years ive dealt with weak dark roasts iced coffees with a kcup are a joke while nothing will come close to espresso out of a keurig i recommend the mypressi twist v2 if you are on a budget the sumatra dark from starbucks is the best kcup yet it is smooth dark and even brewed with crema this is not acidic like many of the south american blend kcups it is slightly more expensive but it has made me start using my keurig again   i would have given it 5 stars but one cup of the 5 ive made so far came out a touch weak  do yourself a favor if you shelled out the cash on a keurig get the

several wet naps or a clothing change if you give these as a snack  second and more importantly they are hard  when my daughter is 3/4 finished with hers she stuffs the whole thing in her mouth  it

'buyer beware please this sweetener is not for everybody  maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body  you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhea  headaches can also be experienced i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell  i thought id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before  i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping  as the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant  though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market  the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness id eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it in case youre like me  its not you its the maltitol', 'here in ma  gooseberries are a rare findhence the canned gooseberries are the

great latte  my only complaint is that the cost does add up quickly since you need both the tea and the powder to make their chai latte  but its a nice indulgence when you want it  and a great alternative for noncoffee drinking guests  cant say enough good things about the cbtl capsule system', 'this product that comes in the amazon packaging is defective it appears in an attempt to save cost too little foil material is used to seal the top of the kcup  as a result when the kcup is punctured by the keurig coffee maker the foil lid separates from the side of the kcup resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker  only 1 of 3 kcups did not do this  it is specifically this brand/packaging since i was making other varieties of kcup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker looking at the seal on this product compared to other kcups varieties this seal is much tighter and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this kcup theres a lot more to make a mess loved the taste of the coffee but cant waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot  dont buy in the amazon hasslefree packaging youll be sorry', 'i will admit the icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an xlr jack to your computer using a usb jack it does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software  beyond that the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level  i tried this with an akg 200 blue encore 200 and an akg 4500 all deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain i could barely get an audible record level yelling into the encore 200 my staple for location voice recording normally i plug the encore directly into a digital audio recorder with an xlr cable no mic preamp no phantom power no eq and i get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level  this is one very disappointing product if you route your mic through a preamp then put the icicle between the preamp and the usb input of your computer you can get a decent record level but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid personally i think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip or mic preamp and an xlr to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the icicle altogether  blue makes some great products but this is not one of their better ones  for those that dont know channel strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box typically a mic preamp and a compressor higher end units add some eq capability as well or have other options', 'im usually a fan of amys organics  they

this wonderful concoction in a department store in okinawa my buddy and i each bought a bottle almost as an after thought it gets brutally hot and humid there and wandered back out into the street we couldnt open the bottle no matter how much we twisted and pried and appealed to examples of familiar american packaging eventually we were forced to go back inside and ask the sales girl for assistance which she very graciously gave us although you could tell she thought it was funny and i suppose it was at that see this stuff even transcends the language barrier if youre reading this calloway i want my 200 yen back  the top of the cap must be punctured in order to open and the neck of the bottle narrows to a point about midway up or down if you will you can see the indentation i refer to in the picture above a small marble is allowed to roll freely in the upper chamber resting while upright on top of the narrow hole so that when you tilt the bottle back to sip the marble rolls out and allows liquid to pass the choke point we got such a kick out of this unique design that we both bought more bottles to take to sea i still have some of the okinawa vintage left but im not sure it would still be good to drink  the flavor i had was a cross between citrus and bubble gum certainly not your standard cocacola sugar rush sorry i like coke too but comparisons must be made i understand other flavors are available and are no doubt just as good oddly enough i didnt see this product offered for sale very often on the kanto plain but i probably just didnt know where to look

tried more than one spice blend from this company via grocery store and their website and thus far it has never failed to be delicious this particular one is probably my personal favorite it is a little bit spicy but contrary to what many people believe about thai cooking it is not always outrageously hot this has a spicy sweet kick to it id rate it about a 5 on a one to ten heat index    try using this on chicken breasts that you are pan sauteing put your chicken breasts boneless/skinless in a hot frying pan that you have put about a tablespoon of oil into can use cooking spray also after one side has browned flip it add the seasoning blend brown the other side put on your plate and season that side it goes wonderfully with rice noodles or brown rice the seasoning itself also goes great in the brown rice or stirred into the noodles its a great way to make a relatively low fat/low calorie meal taste outstanding  if you like this blend you have to try their others deliciously dill is also a personal favorite', 'these are wonderful for travel and snacks  the taste is great  most rawfood that is suppose to taste like something cooked doesnt to me  this does  they have a new

are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils no high fructose corn syrup and no msg  they contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber  the packaging doesnt specify if it is soluble or insoluble  the chips are delicious  they are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip  the flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip fritos only without the added fat  i can see where some people say they have a stale taste  there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you dont expect to taste in a corn chip  i recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that wont blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out  i tried the buffalo flavor this weekend and they have a very mild kick much milder than i expected  i still like them but not as much as the plain', 'we picked this

50/50 shot of it coming off in one piece then once you actually get it open the popcorn has a hint of plastic to it the top and bottom of the bowl arent paper like a regular bag of microwave popcorn

treats texas toothpicks are safer and healthier alternative to rawhide for dogs of all ages and sizes  my beloved dachshund tele began vomitting blood this past friday  i rushed her to the vet and they immediately took her for xrays as they assumed she must have ingested something dangerous  there was a huge pointed and jagged bone fragment lodged in her upper abdomen  they feared that the bloody vomit might be due to the stomach being punctured so they needed to do emergency surgery to remove it before it did puncture the stomach or worse  it was also clear by the size and shape that she would not be able to pass it naturally and safely even if it wasnt lodged  luckily tele is recovering so far but it has been hell for me and her of course especially considering i as a loving parent had given her this treat  so after 2000 in medical costs the fear of almost losing my beloved tele and 1014 days of recovery for her i urge you to reconsider texas toothpicks for your pets i

this is a good one the reason i gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isnt as pure as it could be contains additives and flavorings and i can tell i prefer a more subtle tea and i save five stars for the very best teas ive tried but for those of you who like a lot of flavor and cant taste the additives its just fine  recommended ', 'we have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap purina makes to wellness and for most of the flavors they love it they like it much better than friskies yesterday was the first time we tried the salmon and trout flavor and absolutely none of them would touch it they left it in their dishes all day and went hungry  ill still give it 3 stars because overall wellness is better than anything else out there just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders', 'you will need to add more milk than called for on the package  i dont know why bobs doesnt listen to its customers and rework the instructions  you wont get a pourable batter because this is gluten free baking but you will want to make it wetter and lighter  i think the product is improved by adding some extra gf cornmeal too', 'i used these for a craft at christmas time they came quickly and were exactly as i expected worked excellent for what i needed them for and at this price i still was able to make a profit', 'excellent coffee wonderful rich roast terrific packaging and can you can reuse the can to store other coffee']\n"
